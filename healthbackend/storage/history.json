      "diet": "Given your symptom of mild chest pain after climbing stairs, a recent normal ECG, and your doctor's suspicion of anxiety, it's excellent that you've already consulted a medical professional. This diet guidance is designed to support overall health, heart well-being, and potentially help manage anxiety, but it is **not a replacement for your doctor's advice or a personalized plan from a registered dietitian.** Always discuss any significant dietary changes with your doctor, especially given your symptoms.\n\nThe lifestyle agent's advice to prioritize seeing a doctor and avoiding activities that trigger pain until medically cleared remains paramount.\n\nHere's a safe, balanced diet plan focusing on whole foods that can benefit both physical and mental well-being:\n\n---\n\n### **General Diet Guidance: Heart-Healthy & Anxiety-Supportive**\n\nThis plan emphasizes nutrient-dense foods that support cardiovascular health and can help stabilize mood and energy levels, which may be beneficial if anxiety is a factor.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n*   **Whole Foods Focus:** Prioritize foods in their most natural, unprocessed state.\n*   **Balanced Macronutrients:** Aim for a good balance of complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and healthy fats at each meal.\n*   **Regular Meals:** Eat regular meals and snacks to maintain stable blood sugar levels, which can help manage energy and mood.\n*   **Mindful Eating:** Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues, and eat slowly without distractions.\n\n---\n\n### **Foods to Prefer (Eat More Of):**\n\n1.  **Whole Grains:**\n    *   **Examples:** Oats (rolled or steel-cut), brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread/pasta (100% whole grain), barley, farro.\n    *   **Benefits:** Provide sustained energy, fiber for digestive health, and B vitamins which are important for nerve function and energy metabolism.\n\n2.  **Fruits & Vegetables (Aim for a Rainbow):**\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Leafy Greens:** Spinach, kale, collard greens (rich in magnesium, B vitamins, antioxidants).\n        *   **Cruciferous Veggies:** Broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts.\n        *   **Berries:** Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries (high in antioxidants).\n        *   **Citrus Fruits:** Oranges, grapefruits (Vitamin C).\n        *   **Other:** Apples, bananas, avocados, bell peppers, carrots, sweet potatoes.\n    *   **Benefits:** Packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber.

The lifestyle agent's advice to **avoid activities that trigger pain** and **see a doctor immediately** remains paramount.\n\nOnce your doctor has thoroughly evaluated your condition and given you specific clearance for physical activity, we can consider some very gentle, low-intensity options. Even then, these activities must be approached with extreme caution and mindfulness.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Low-Risk, Gentle Physical Activities (ONLY After Doctor's Clearance):**\n\nThese activities are designed to be very gentle and focus on movement without strain.\n\n1.  **Gentle Walking (on flat surfaces):**\n    *   **How:** Start with very short walks, perhaps 5-10 minutes, on a flat, even surface. Focus on a comfortable, unhurried pace.\n    *   **Frequency:** Maybe once or twice a day, if you feel well and your doctor approves.\n    *   **Focus:** Pay attention to your breathing and how your body feels. This is not about speed or distance, but about gentle movement.\n\n2.  **Slow, Gentle Stretching:**\n    *   **How:** Focus on static stretches for major muscle groups (e.g., gentle arm circles, neck rolls, hamstring stretches while seated or lying down). Hold each stretch for 15-30 seconds, breathing deeply.\n    *   **Avoid:** Bouncing, deep stretches that cause discomfort, or any stretches that put strain on your chest or breathing.\n    *   **Focus:** Improve flexibility and reduce muscle tension. This can also be a calming activity.\n\n3.  **Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n    *   **How:** Sit or lie comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your abdomen rise. Exhale slowly through pursed lips, feeling your abdomen fall.\n    *   **Frequency:** Practice for 5-10 minutes, several times a day.\n    *   **Benefits:** This is a safe activity that can help manage anxiety, promote relaxation, and improve lung capacity without physical exertion.\n\n4.  **Chair-Based Gentle Movement:**\n    *   **How:** While seated, perform gentle movements like ankle circles, wrist circles, shoulder shrugs, and very gentle leg lifts (one leg at a time, just a few inches off the floor).\n    *   **Focus:** Maintain some mobility without putting stress on your cardiovascular system.\n\n---\n\n### **Absolute Safety Instructions:**\n\n*   **STOP IMMEDIATELY IF YOU FEEL ANY PAIN OR DISCOMFORT:** This is the most important rule. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness, unusual fatigue, or any other concerning symptoms, stop the activity at once.\n*   **Start Very Slowly:** Begin with the shortest duration and lowest intensity. Do not push yourself.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Pay close attention to how you feel during and after any activity. If you feel tired or unwell, rest.\n*   **No Heavy Lifting or Strenuous Activity:** Until medically cleared for more intense exercise, avoid anything that significantly raises your heart rate or makes you feel out of breath. This includes lifting heavy objects, running, jumping, or intense cardio.\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Drink water before, during, and after any activity, as advised by your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** Your health and safety are paramount.

Gentle Stretching & Mobility (Post-Clearance):**\n*   **What:** Simple, static stretches that focus on relaxation and improving flexibility, not pushing to your limit.\n*   **How:**\n    *   **Neck Rolls:** Gently roll your head from side to side, ear towards shoulder.\n    *   **Shoulder Rolls:** Roll shoulders forward and backward slowly.\n    *   **Arm Stretches:** Gentle arm circles or reaching overhead (if comfortable).\n    *   **Cat-Cow Stretch (on hands and knees, if comfortable):** Gently arch and round your back.\n    *   **Seated Forward Fold:** Sit on the floor with legs extended, gently reach towards your toes (only as far as comfortable, no strain).\n*   **Focus:** Hold each stretch for 15-30 seconds, breathing deeply. Never bounce or force a stretch.\n*   **Important:** Avoid any stretches that put pressure on your chest or cause any discomfort.\n\n**3. Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n*   **What:** Focused breathing techniques that can help calm the nervous system and manage anxiety. This can be done anytime, anywhere, even without physical movement.\n*   **How:**\n    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing (Belly Breathing):** Lie down or sit comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise. Exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your belly fall. Your chest hand should remain relatively still.\n    *   **Box Breathing:** Inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4. Repeat.\n*   **Focus:** Aim for slow, controlled breaths. This is excellent for stress management.\n\n**4. Mindful Movement (e.g., Chair Yoga or Very Gentle Tai Chi - Post-Clearance):**\n*   **What:** These practices emphasize slow, deliberate movements coordinated with breath, promoting relaxation and body awareness.\n*   **How:** Look for beginner-level, chair-based yoga or very gentle Tai Chi classes or online videos. These often focus on seated or standing movements with support, minimizing strain.\n*   **Focus:** The emphasis is on fluidity, balance, and mental calm, not on strength or flexibility extremes.\n*   **Important:** Ensure the instructor is aware of your health concerns, or choose programs specifically designed for seniors or those with limited mobility. **Again, stop immediately if any movement causes pain or discomfort.**\n\n---\n\n**Key Reminders:**\n\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** This is your most important guide. If something doesn't feel right, stop.\n*   **Consistency Over Intensity:** Short, regular sessions are more beneficial than infrequent, strenuous ones.\n*   **Hydration:** Ensure you are well-hydrated before, during, and after any activity.\n*   **Comfortable Attire:** Wear loose, comfortable clothing and supportive shoes for walking.\n\nYour health is paramount. Please prioritize your doctor's advice and use these suggestions only as a very gentle starting point once you have received medical clearance.",

The most important rule is to **stop immediately if you feel any pain, discomfort, or worsening of your chest pain at any point.**\n\n---\n\n### **Important Precaution:**\n**Do NOT begin any of these activities until you have consulted with your doctor and received their clearance. If at any point during these activities you feel ANY pain, discomfort, dizziness, shortness of breath, or worsening of your chest pain, STOP IMMEDIATELY and rest. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention.**\n\n---\n\n### **Low-Risk, Gentle Physical Activities (Post-Medical Clearance):**\n\nThese activities are designed to be very mild and easy to stop at a moment's notice.\n\n1.  **Gentle Walking (Very Short Duration):**\n    *   **How to do it:** Start with a very slow, leisurely pace. Walk for just 5-10 minutes on a flat, even surface (like inside your home or a very short, flat path).\n    *   **Focus:** Pay attention to your body. Is your breathing comfortable? Do you feel any chest discomfort?\n    *   **Progression (ONLY with doctor's approval and no pain):** If 5-10 minutes feels absolutely fine for several days, you might *very gradually* increase the duration by 1-2 minutes, but always stay well within your comfort zone.\n\n2.  **Seated Gentle Stretches:**\n    *   **How to do it:** While seated comfortably, perform very gentle stretches for your neck, shoulders, and arms. Avoid any stretches that put direct pressure or strain on your chest area, especially if that's where you feel pain.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Neck Tilts:** Gently tilt your head to one side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder. Hold for 10-15 seconds. Repeat on the other side.\n        *   **Shoulder Rolls:** Slowly roll your shoulders forward a few times, then backward a few times.\n        *   **Arm Reaches:** Gently reach one arm overhead, then the other.\n    *   **Focus:** Move slowly and smoothly. Do not bounce or force any stretch. You should feel a gentle pull, not pain.\n\n3.  **Diaphragmatic (Belly) Breathing:**\n    *   **How to do it:** Lie down or sit comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise more than your chest. Exhale slowly through pursed lips, feeling your belly fall.\n    *   **Focus:** This is a relaxation technique that can also gently engage your diaphragm. It should feel calming, not strenuous.\n    *   **Duration:** Practice for 5-10 minutes, focusing on slow, deep breaths.\n\n---\n\n**Key Principles for Any Activity:**\n\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** This is paramount. Your body will give you signals. If something doesn't feel right, stop.\n*   **No Pain, No Gain does NOT apply here:** If you feel pain, it's a signal to stop.\n*   **Hydration:** Ensure you are well-hydrated before and after any activity.\n*   **Consistency over Intensity:** If cleared, short, regular bouts of gentle movement are better than pushing too hard occasionally.\n\nAgain, your mild chest pain is a symptom that requires medical attention first.

Remember to start very slowly and gradually increase duration or intensity only if you feel comfortable and have no symptoms.\n\n**Goal:** To gently introduce movement and improve overall well-being without putting undue stress on your body.\n\n**Frequency:** Aim for 3-5 days a week, with rest days in between.\n\n**Duration:** Start with very short sessions (e.g., 5-10 minutes) and gradually increase by 1-2 minutes per session if you feel well.\n\n**Intensity:** You should be able to carry on a conversation easily throughout the activity. This is not about pushing yourself.\n\n---\n\n**1. Gentle Walking:**\n*   **Activity:** Start with a very slow, leisurely walk around your home or a flat, safe area.\n*   **How to do it:** Walk at a pace where you can comfortably talk or even sing. Focus on a smooth, relaxed gait.\n*   **Progression (only if cleared by doctor and symptom-free):** Gradually increase the duration of your walk by a minute or two each week. You might eventually aim for a brisk walk, but only after consistent symptom-free gentle walking and doctor's approval.\n*   **Constraint:** **Stop immediately if you feel any chest pain, shortness of breath, or unusual fatigue.**\n\n**2. Light Stretching / Gentle Mobility:**\n*   **Activity:** Simple, static stretches to improve flexibility and reduce muscle tension.\n*   **How to do it:**\n    *   **Neck Rolls:** Gently roll your head from side to side, then forward and back.\n    *   **Shoulder Rolls:** Roll your shoulders forward and backward in small circles.\n    *   **Arm Circles:** Small, slow circles with your arms, forward and backward.\n    *   **Cat-Cow Stretch (on hands and knees):** Gently arch and round your back.\n    *   **Seated Hamstring Stretch:** Sit on the floor with one leg extended, gently reach towards your toes (don't force it).\n    *   **Hold each stretch for 15-20 seconds, breathing deeply.**\n*   **Progression (only if cleared by doctor and symptom-free):** You can explore more gentle yoga or Pilates stretches, but always with caution.\n*   **Constraint:** **Avoid any stretches that cause pain or strain, especially in the chest or upper body.** Move slowly and deliberately.\n\n**3. Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n*   **Activity:** Focus on controlled, diaphragmatic breathing.\n*   **How to do it:**\n    *   Find a comfortable seated or lying position.\n    *   Place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen.\n    *   Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your abdomen rise (the hand on your chest should move very little).\n    *   Exhale slowly through pursed lips, feeling your abdomen fall.\n    *   Repeat for 5-10 minutes.\n*   **Benefits:** Can help reduce stress and promote relaxation.\n*   **Constraint:** **If deep breathing causes or worsens chest pain, stop and consult your doctor.**\n\n**4. Chair Exercises (if standing is difficult or causes discomfort):**\n*   **Activity:** Gentle movements performed while seated.\n*   **How to do it:**\n    *   **Seated Marching:** Lift your knees alternately as if marching.\n    *   **Ankle Circles:** Rotate your ankles in both directions.\n    *   **Arm Raises:** Gently raise your arms out to the sides or forward, not above shoulder height initially.\n    *   **Seated Torso Twists:** Gently twist your upper body from side to side.\n*   **Constraint:** **Perform all movements slowly and within a comfortable range of motion. Stop if any pain occurs.**\n\n---\n\n**Key Reminders from Your Cautious Fitness Coach:**\n\n*   **Doctor First:** Your chest pain must be medically evaluated before you begin any physical activity.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** This is paramount. Pain is a signal to stop.\n*   **Start Slow, Go Slow:** Begin with minimal duration and intensity.\n*   **Consistency over Intensity:** Regular, gentle movement is more beneficial than sporadic, intense bursts.\n*   **Hydrate:** Drink water before, during, and after any activity.\n\nYour health and safety are my top priority. Please prioritize seeing your doctor.",
      "synthesized_guidance": "It is **paramount and non-negotiable** that you seek immediate medical evaluation for your mild chest pain. All agents (symptom, lifestyle, diet, and fitness) have consistently emphasized that chest pain, regardless of its perceived mildness, can indicate serious underlying conditions and requires professional medical diagnosis and guidance. None of the advice provided here is a substitute for a doctor's assessment or treatment plan.\n\nOnce you have consulted with a healthcare professional and received clearance, the following general recommendations for overall well-being can be considered:\n\n**Dietary Guidance:** Focus on a balanced, nutrient-dense diet. Prioritize whole foods such as a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains (oats, brown rice, quinoa), lean proteins (skinless poultry, fish, legumes, tofu), and healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil). Ensure adequate hydration by drinking plenty of water. Conversely, it is crucial to limit or avoid highly processed foods, sugary drinks, excessive saturated and trans fats, high-sodium foods, and excessive caffeine or alcohol. Practice mindful eating and be aware of portion sizes.\n\n**Lifestyle Adjustments:** Adopt healthy lifestyle habits that support overall health. This includes prioritizing good sleep hygiene by maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine. Implement stress management techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, engaging in hobbies, and connecting with others. Avoid smoking or vaping entirely, and consume alcohol only in moderation if at all. Maintain regular medical check-ups.\n\n**Fitness Recommendations:** **Absolutely do not engage in any physical activity until your chest pain has been medically evaluated and you have received explicit clearance from your doctor.** If cleared, begin with very low-risk, gentle physical activities. Examples include gentle walking at a comfortable pace, light stretching, gentle mobility exercises, and deep breathing exercises. Start with very short durations (e.g., 5-10 minutes) and low intensity, gradually increasing only if you remain completely symptom-free and have your doctor's approval. **Crucially, if you experience any pain, discomfort, dizziness, shortness of breath, or worsening of your chest pain during any activity, stop immediately and seek medical attention.**\n\nIn summary, your first and most important step is to see a doctor for your chest pain.

This could include designated times for meals, rest, and light activities.\n    *   **Why:** Provides a sense of normalcy and can help manage energy levels.\n\n2.  **Listen to Your Body:**\n    *   **Tip:** Pay close attention to your body's signals. If you feel tired, rest. If you feel dizzy, sit down. Don't push through discomfort.\n    *   **Why:** Crucial for recovery and preventing symptoms from worsening.\n\n3.  **Break Tasks into Smaller Steps:**\n    *   **Tip:** If you have tasks to complete, break them down into very small, manageable chunks. Take frequent breaks.\n    *   **Why:** Prevents overwhelm and conserves energy.\n\n---\n\n**Important Constraint:** **Avoid self-diagnosing or relying solely on lifestyle changes to address these symptoms.** The occasional dizziness, in particular, warrants professional medical attention to ensure there isn't an underlying issue that needs specific treatment.

If at any point you feel worse, experience increased dizziness, pain, or any discomfort, **STOP IMMEDIATELY.**\n\n---\n\n### **Gentle Movement Plan (If Cleared by Doctor & Symptoms Allow)**\n\nThe focus here is on very low-intensity, restorative movements that support circulation and flexibility without taxing your system. This is not about \"working out\" but about gentle self-care.\n\n**Phase 1: Focus on Rest and Breathing (Always Safe & Recommended)**\n\n1.  **Deep Diaphragmatic Breathing:**\n    *   **How:** Lie down or sit comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise. Exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your belly fall.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes, 2-3 times a day.\n    *   **Why:** Promotes relaxation, helps oxygenate your body, and can reduce stress and tension that might contribute to headaches.\n\n2.  **Mindful Rest Periods:**\n    *   **How:** Schedule short periods (15-30 minutes) of complete rest throughout your day. This could be lying down, sitting quietly, or light reading.\n    *   **Why:** Allows your body to conserve energy and recover.\n\n**Phase 2: Very Gentle Mobility (Only if Dizziness is Absent and You Feel Stable)**\n\n**Important:** Perform these movements slowly and deliberately. If you feel any dizziness, lightheadedness, or increased pain, stop immediately and rest.\n\n1.  **Gentle Neck Stretches (Seated or Lying Down):**\n    *   **How:** Slowly tilt your head to bring your ear towards your shoulder (don't force it). Hold for 10-15 seconds. Repeat on the other side. Gently nod your head up and down, then side to side.\n    *   **Repetitions:** 2-3 times each direction.\n    *   **Why:** Can help relieve tension that contributes to headaches and body pain.\n\n2.  **Shoulder Rolls (Seated or Standing, if stable):**\n    *   **How:** Gently roll your shoulders forward in a circular motion, then backward.\n    *   **Repetitions:** 5-10 rolls in each direction.\n    *   **Why:** Improves circulation and reduces stiffness in the upper back and shoulders.\n\n3.  **Wrist and Ankle Circles (Seated or Lying Down):**\n    *   **How:** Gently rotate your wrists in circles, then reverse direction. Do the same with your ankles.\n    *   **Repetitions:** 5-10 circles in each direction for each joint.\n    *   **Why:** Promotes circulation in extremities and prevents stiffness.\n\n4.  **Knee to Chest Stretch (Lying Down):**\n    *   **How:** Lie on your back. Gently bring one knee towards your chest, holding it with your hands. Hold for 15-20 seconds. Release and repeat with the other leg.\n    *   **Repetitions:** 2-3 times per leg.\n    *   **Why:** Gently stretches the lower back and hips.\n\n**Phase 3: Very Short, Slow Walks (Only if Dizziness is Completely Absent and You Feel Strong Enough)**\n\n1.  **Indoor or Safe Outdoor Walk:**\n    *   **How:** If you feel completely stable and free of dizziness, take a very short, slow walk in a familiar, safe environment (e.g., around your living room, a short, flat path in your garden).\n    *   **Duration:** Start with 2-5 minutes. If you feel good, you *might* gradually increase to 10 minutes, but always prioritize how you feel.\n    *   **Constraint:** **Avoid uneven surfaces, stairs, or crowded areas.** Have someone with you if you feel at all unsteady.\n    *   **Why:** Gentle movement can improve circulation and mood, but must be approached with extreme caution.\n\n---\n\n### **General Safety Guidelines & Constraints:**\n\n*   **Listen to Your Body Above All Else:** This is the most important rule. If something doesn't feel right, stop.\n*   **No Pushing Through Pain:** Pain is a signal to stop.\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Continue to sip water throughout the day, especially if you engage in any movement.\n*   **Avoid Heavy Exercise:** Absolutely no strenuous activities, heavy lifting, high-impact movements, or anything that significantly raises your heart rate or challenges your balance.\n*   **Rest is Key:** Prioritize rest and sleep as advised by your doctor.\n*   **Consult Your Doctor:** Reiterate that these are *supportive* suggestions and not a replacement for medical advice.

If possible, lighten your workload or postpone non-essential tasks.

The key is to listen intently to your body and prioritize recovery above all else.\n\n**Always remember to stop immediately if you feel any pain, discomfort, increased coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness, or worsening fatigue.**\n\n### Recommended Gentle Activities:\n\n1.  **Short, Slow Walks:**\n    *   **Duration:** Start with just 5-10 minutes. If that feels okay, you *might* extend to 15-20 minutes, but do not push it.\n    *   **Intensity:** Keep it very slow, more like a leisurely stroll than brisk walking. You should be able to hold a full conversation effortlessly.\n    *   **Environment:** Walk indoors or in a mild, comfortable outdoor environment. Avoid extreme temperatures, high winds, or polluted areas.\n    *   **Focus:** The goal is gentle movement, not cardiovascular training.\n\n2.  **Gentle Stretching:**\n    *   **Focus:** Focus on large muscle groups like your back, shoulders, and legs.\n    *   **Type:** Perform very light, static stretches.

Avoid anything that causes strain or holds your breath.\n    *   **Example:** Gentle neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, arm circles, cat-cow stretch (if comfortable on hands and knees), or a gentle hamstring stretch while seated.\n\n3.  **Mindful Breathing Exercises:**\n    *   **Focus:** Simple diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing).\n    *   **How:** Lie down or sit comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise.

Movement & Activity\nDuring this time, rest is paramount. If you feel a slight improvement and genuinely have the energy, consider only very gentle activities.\n*   **Prioritize Rest:** Your body needs energy for recovery, so avoid strenuous activity.\n*   **Short, Slow Walks:** If you feel up to it, take very gentle, slow walks for 5-10 minutes.

Drink consistently throughout the day.\n    *   **Herbal Teas:** Warm teas like ginger, chamomile, peppermint, or licorice root can be very soothing for a sore throat and cough.

      "fitness": "As a cautious fitness coach, my primary recommendation given your symptoms (mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and fatigue from a suspected viral infection) is to **prioritize rest and recovery.** Your body is working hard to fight off the infection, and strenuous exercise can hinder this process and potentially worsen your symptoms or prolong your recovery.\n\nHowever, if you feel a *slight* improvement in your energy levels and your symptoms remain mild, very gentle movement can sometimes be beneficial for circulation and mood. The key here is **low-risk, low-intensity, and short duration.**\n\n**Always remember to consult your doctor before resuming any heavy exercise, and listen intently to your body.**\n\nHere are some low-risk, gentle physical activities you might consider, but only if you feel up to it:\n\n1.  **Gentle Walking (Short Duration):**\n    *   **Activity:** A very slow, leisurely walk around your home, garden, or a quiet block.\n    *   **Intensity:** Keep it at a pace where you can easily hold a conversation without any breathlessness. It should feel effortless.\n    *   **Duration:** Start with just 5-10 minutes. If you feel good, you *might* extend it to 15-20 minutes, but do not push it.\n    *   **Focus:** Enjoy the fresh air (if weather permits and you're not spreading germs) and gentle movement, not on getting your heart rate up.\n\n2.  **Light Stretching or Gentle Yoga (Restorative Poses):**\n    *   **Activity:** Focus on slow, static stretches that improve flexibility and ease tension, rather than building strength or intense flexibility. Think gentle neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, cat-cow stretches, or child's pose.\n    *   **Intensity:** No deep stretches that cause discomfort. Move slowly and gently.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes.\n    *   **Focus:** Relaxation, gentle mobility, and deep breathing. Avoid any inversions or poses that put pressure on your head or chest.\n\n3.  **Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n    *   **Activity:** Sit or lie comfortably and focus on slow, deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose, allowing your belly to rise, and exhale slowly through your mouth.\n    *   **Intensity:** Very low. This is about calming your nervous system and improving lung capacity gently.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes.\n    *   **Focus:** Relaxation and mindful breathing. This can be particularly helpful for a cough or congestion.\n\n---\n\n**Crucial Guidelines \u2013 When to STOP Immediately:**\n\n*   **Pain or Discomfort:** If you feel any pain, sharp sensations, or unusual discomfort.\n*   **Worsening Symptoms:** If your sore throat, cough, runny nose, or fatigue increases.\n*   **Dizziness or Lightheadedness:** Any feeling of unsteadiness.\n*   **Shortness of Breath:** If you feel breathless beyond what is normal for the very gentle activity.\n*   **Chest Pain or Pressure:** This is a serious symptom and requires immediate medical attention.\n*   **Increased Fatigue:** If the activity makes you feel more tired rather than refreshed.\n\n---\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n*   **Hydrate:** Continue to drink plenty of fluids before, during (if applicable), and after any activity.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** This is the most important rule. Your body is telling you what it needs. If you feel tired, rest. If you feel worse, stop.\n*   **No Strenuous Exercise:** Absolutely avoid anything that significantly raises your heart rate, makes you sweat heavily, or causes you to breathe hard. This includes running, weightlifting, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), or team sports.\n*   **Monitor Your Symptoms:** Keep a close eye on how you feel. If your symptoms worsen, you develop a fever, or experience any new concerning symptoms, please consult your doctor.\n\nYour priority right now is healing.

Aim for 8-10 hours of sleep per night, and consider short naps (20-30 minutes) if needed during the day, but avoid long naps that might disrupt nighttime sleep.\n    *   **Consistent Sleep Schedule (as much as possible):** Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on weekends, to regulate your body's internal clock.\n\n2.  **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:**\n    *   **Dark, Quiet, Cool:** Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and kept at a comfortable, cool temperature.\n    *   **Humidifier:** A cool-mist humidifier can help soothe a dry cough and sore throat by adding moisture to the air.\n    *   **Elevate Your Head:** If your cough or runny nose is worse when lying flat, try propping your head up with an extra pillow to help with drainage and ease breathing.\n\n3.  **Pre-Sleep Routine:**\n    *   **Wind-Down Activities:** Engage in relaxing activities before bed, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath or shower, or listening to calming music.\n    *   **Limit Screen Time:** Avoid screens (phones, tablets, computers, TV) for at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light can interfere with melatonin production.\n\n### Stress Management\n\n1.  **Reduce Commitments:**\n    *   **Say No:** Don't be afraid to decline extra tasks or social engagements.

Don't try to push through fatigue.\n    *   **Listen to Your Body's Signals:** If you feel tired, rest. If you feel a cough coming on, take a moment to recover.\n\n2.  **Warm Beverages Throughout the Day:**\n    *   Keep a thermos of warm water, herbal tea, or broth nearby to sip on regularly. This helps keep your throat moist and can provide comfort.\n\n3.  **Limit Exposure to Irritants:**\n    *   **Avoid Smoke:** Stay away from cigarette smoke and other airborne irritants that can worsen your cough and sore throat.\n    *   **Clean Air:** Ensure good ventilation in your living spaces.\n\n4.  **Plan for Recovery:**\n    *   **Stock Up:** Make sure you have essentials at home (tissues, fluids, easy-to-prepare meals) so you don't have to go out unnecessarily.\n    *   **Inform Others:** Let close contacts know you're not feeling well so they can be understanding if you need to cancel plans or take it easy.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you can support your body's natural healing process and manage your symptoms more effectively.

Herbal tea.\n*   **Mid-morning Snack:** A small bowl of warm chicken broth or a soft-cooked egg.\n*   **Lunch:** A bowl of nourishing vegetable soup with soft-cooked pasta or rice, or shredded chicken with mashed sweet potato. Water.\n*   **Afternoon Snack:** Applesauce or a few slices of melon. Herbal tea with honey.\n*   **Dinner:** Poached fish with well-steamed zucchini, or a lentil soup. Water.\n*   **Before Bed:** Warm chamomile tea with honey.\n\nRemember to prioritize rest, stay hydrated, and listen to your body's signals.

      "fitness": "As your cautious fitness coach, my primary recommendation when you're experiencing symptoms like a mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and evening fatigue, even with a doctor's suspected viral infection and no serious findings, is to **prioritize rest and recovery.** Your body is working hard to fight off the infection, and strenuous activity can hinder this process and potentially worsen your symptoms.\n\nThe goal of any physical activity at this time is to maintain very gentle movement and circulation, not to build fitness or push your limits.\n\n**Always remember to consult your doctor before starting any new exercise regimen, especially when unwell. This guidance is general and not a substitute for professional medical advice.**\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Low-Risk, Gentle Physical Activities\n\nThese activities are designed to be very mild and should only be attempted if you feel up to it. The moment you feel any pain, discomfort, increased fatigue, or worsening of symptoms, **STOP IMMEDIATELY.**\n\n1.  **Gentle Walking (Short & Slow):**\n    *   **What:** A very slow, leisurely walk. This could be around your home, in your garden, or a very short, flat walk outdoors if the weather is mild and you're not feeling chilled.\n    *   **Duration:** Start with just 5-10 minutes. If you feel okay, you *might* extend it to 15-20 minutes, but do not push it.\n    *   **Intensity:** Keep your pace slow enough that you can easily hold a conversation without any breathlessness. This is not about getting your heart rate up.\n    *   **Focus:** Gentle movement, fresh air (if outdoors), and a change of scenery.\n\n2.  **Light Stretching & Mobility Exercises:**\n    *   **What:** Slow, controlled stretches that focus on gentle range of motion, not deep flexibility or muscle strain. Think about movements that release tension rather than challenge your muscles.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Neck Rolls:** Slowly roll your head from side to side, ear to shoulder.\n        *   **Shoulder Rolls:** Gentle circles forward and backward.\n        *   **Arm Stretches:** Reach arms overhead, gentle side bends.\n        *   **Cat-Cow Stretch (on hands and knees):** Slowly arch and round your back.\n        *   **Gentle Leg Swings:** Small, controlled swings of your legs while holding onto support.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes, focusing on smooth, fluid movements.\n    *   **Intensity:** No strain, no bouncing. Move only within a comfortable range of motion.\n    *   **Focus:** Releasing stiffness, improving circulation, and promoting relaxation.\n\n3.  **Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n    *   **What:** Focused, slow, deep breaths that engage your diaphragm. This is not strenuous but can help with lung function and relaxation.\n    *   **How:** Sit or lie comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise. Exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your belly fall.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes, several times a day.\n    *   **Intensity:** Very low. The goal is calm, controlled breathing.\n    *   **Focus:** Relaxation, improving oxygen intake, and potentially helping with cough management.\n\n---\n\n### Crucial Guidelines & When to Stop\n\n*   **Listen to Your Body Above All Else:** This is the most important rule. Your body is sending you signals.\n*   **STOP IMMEDIATELY if you experience:**\n    *   **Any pain or discomfort.**\n    *   **Increased fatigue or exhaustion.**\n    *   **Worsening of your sore throat, cough, or runny nose.**\n    *   **Dizziness, lightheadedness, or nausea.**\n    *   **Shortness of breath or chest discomfort.**\n    *   **New symptoms like fever, chills, or body aches.**\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Continue to sip on water and other recommended fluids before, during, and after any gentle movement.\n*   **Prioritize Rest:** If you feel tired, choose rest over activity. Sleep is your body's most powerful recovery tool.\n*   **Avoid:**\n    *   Any high-intensity exercise (running, jumping, heavy lifting, vigorous sports).\n    *   Activities that make you breathe heavily or feel out of breath.\n    *   Exercising in extreme temperatures (too hot or too cold).\n    *   Pushing through any discomfort.\n\nYour recovery is the priority. Be kind to your body, give it the rest and gentle care it needs, and ease back into more activity only when your symptoms have fully resolved and you feel your energy levels have returned to normal. If you have any doubts or your symptoms persist or worsen, please consult your doctor again.",

Here are some lifestyle changes and constraints:\n\n---\n\n### Lifestyle Habits: Nurturing Your Body\n\n1.  **Hydration is Key:**\n    *   **Increase Fluid Intake:** Sip on warm water, herbal teas (like ginger, chamomile, or peppermint), clear broths, and water throughout the day. This helps soothe a sore throat, thin mucus, and prevent dehydration, which is crucial when feeling unwell.\n    *   **Avoid Dehydrating Drinks:** Limit caffeine and alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration and may interfere with sleep.\n\n2.  **Nutrient-Rich Nourishment:**\n    *   **Focus on Whole Foods:** Prioritize easily digestible, nutrient-dense foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Think soups, smoothies, steamed vegetables, and soft fruits.\n    *   **Support Immune Function:** Include foods rich in Vitamin C (citrus, berries, bell peppers) and Zinc (nuts, seeds, legumes, lean meats).\n    *   **Avoid Irritants:** Steer clear of very spicy, acidic, or crunchy foods that might irritate your sore throat. Processed foods and excessive sugar can also be counterproductive to recovery.\n\n3.  **Gentle Movement (Listen to Your Body):**\n    *   **Rest is Paramount:** Your body is working hard to recover, so prioritize rest over strenuous activity.\n    *   **Light Activity Only:** If you feel up to it, very gentle activities like short, slow walks (10-15 minutes) or light stretching can be beneficial for circulation and mood, but stop immediately if you feel more fatigued or symptoms worsen.\n    *   **Avoid Strenuous Exercise:** High-intensity workouts or heavy lifting should be completely avoided until your symptoms have fully resolved and your energy levels return to normal. Pushing yourself can prolong recovery.\n\n4.  **Personal Hygiene:**\n    *   **Frequent Handwashing:** Wash your hands thoroughly and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose.\n    *   **Cough and Sneeze Etiquette:** Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, or use the inside of your elbow. Dispose of tissues immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Sleep Hygiene: Prioritizing Rest for Recovery\n\n1.  **Prioritize Sleep:**\n    *   **Aim for 7-9 Hours (or More):** Your body needs extra rest to fight off illness. Go to bed earlier than usual and allow yourself to sleep in if possible.\n    *   **Listen to Fatigue Cues:** If you feel tired during the day, allow yourself short naps (20-30 minutes) to recharge, but avoid long naps that might disrupt nighttime sleep.\n\n2.  **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:**\n    *   **Dark, Quiet, Cool:** Ensure your bedroom is conducive to sleep. Block out light, minimize noise, and keep the temperature comfortably cool (around 60-67\u00b0F or 15-19\u00b0C).\n    *   **Elevate Your Head:** If nasal congestion or cough is bothering you, try sleeping with an extra pillow to elevate your head slightly, which can help with drainage and reduce post-nasal drip.\n\n3.  **Pre-Sleep Routine:**\n    *   **Wind Down:** Engage in relaxing activities before bed, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath or shower (steam can help with congestion), or listening to calming music.\n    *   **Limit Screens:** Avoid bright screens (phones, tablets, computers, TV) for at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light can interfere with melatonin production.\n\n---\n\n### Stress Management: Easing the Mental Load\n\n1.  **Acknowledge and Accept:**\n    *   **Be Kind to Yourself:** It's okay to feel unwell and to slow down. Acknowledge that your body needs time to heal, and don't feel guilty about resting.\n    *   **Listen to Your Body's Signals:** Pay attention to fatigue and other symptoms, and adjust your activities accordingly.\n\n2.  **Simplify and Delegate:**\n    *   **Reduce Commitments:** If possible, postpone non-essential tasks, social engagements, and work deadlines. Communicate your situation to others.\n    *   **Ask for Help:** Don't hesitate to ask family, friends, or colleagues for support with daily chores or responsibilities.\n\n3.  **Mindfulness and Relaxation:**\n    *   **Gentle Breathing Exercises:** Practice slow, deep breathing for a few minutes several times a day. This can help calm your nervous system.\n    *   **Light Meditation/Mindfulness:** Even 5-10 minutes of guided meditation or simply focusing on your breath can reduce stress.\n    *   **Engage in Calming Hobbies:** If you have the energy, gentle activities like reading, listening to music, or light crafting can be soothing.\n\n---\n\n### Daily Routine Tips: Adapting for Recovery\n\n1.  **Pace Yourself:**\n    *   **Break Down Tasks:** If you must do something, break it into smaller, manageable chunks with rest periods in between.\n    *   **Prioritize:** Focus only on the most essential tasks and let go of the rest for now.\n\n2.  **Schedule Rest Periods:**\n    *   **Build in Downtime:** Intentionally schedule periods of rest throughout your day, even if it's just sitting quietly or lying down for 15-30 minutes.\n    *   **Avoid Over-Scheduling:** Do not fill your day with too many activities, even light ones.\n\n3.  **Maintain a Sense of Normalcy (Gently):**\n    *   **Consistent Wake-Up Time (Mostly):** While extra sleep is good, try not to drastically alter your wake-up time by more than an hour or two, even on weekends, to help maintain your circadian rhythm.\n    *   **Fresh Air (If Possible):** If the weather permits and you feel up to it, step outside for a few minutes of fresh air and natural light, which can boost mood and help regulate sleep.\n\n4.  **Environmental Comfort:**\n    *   **Humidifier:** Use a cool-mist humidifier in your bedroom, especially at night, to help soothe your sore throat and ease congestion.\n    *   **Warm Compresses/Showers:** A warm, steamy shower can help clear nasal passages and soothe a cough.\n\n---\n\n**Important Constraint:**\n*   **Avoid Spreading Illness:** If you are feeling unwell, it's best to limit close contact with others, especially vulnerable individuals, to prevent the spread of any potential illness. Work from home if possible, and avoid public gatherings.\n\nRemember, these suggestions are designed to support your body's natural healing process. Listen carefully to your body, and if your symptoms worsen or do not improve, please consult a healthcare professional.",

Add a spoonful of honey for extra comfort (for adults).\n    *   **Clear Broths:** Chicken or vegetable broth provides hydration and electrolytes, and can be very comforting.\n    *   **Diluted Fruit Juices:** Apple or grape juice, diluted with water, can provide some energy and vitamins without being too acidic.\n    *   **Warm Lemon Water:** Can help soothe the throat.\n\n2.  **Soft & Soothing Foods:**\n    *   **Soups:** Chicken noodle soup, vegetable soup, or creamy tomato soup (if not too acidic for your throat) are excellent choices.\n    *   **Mashed Potatoes or Sweet Potatoes:** Easy to swallow and provide energy.\n    *   **Oatmeal or Cream of Wheat:** Warm, soft, and easy to digest.\n    *   **Yogurt:** Plain, unsweetened yogurt can be soothing and provides probiotics (beneficial bacteria).\n    *   **Smoothies:** Blend fruits (like bananas, berries), soft vegetables (spinach), a liquid base (water, almond milk), and a protein source (yogurt, protein powder) for a nutrient-dense, easy-to-consume meal.\n    *   **Scrambled Eggs:** Soft, easy to digest, and a good source of protein.\n    *   **Applesauce or Ripe Bananas:** Gentle on the stomach and provide natural sugars for energy.\n    *   **Soft-Cooked Vegetables:** Steamed carrots, zucchini, or green beans are easier to chew and digest.\n\n3.  **Immune-Supporting Nutrients:**\n    *   **Foods rich in Vitamin C:** While citrus can sometimes irritate a sore throat, other sources like bell peppers (cooked and soft), berries (in smoothies), or kiwi can be beneficial.\n    *   **Foods rich in Zinc:** Lean meats (soft-cooked chicken or fish), legumes, nuts, and seeds (if you can tolerate them without throat irritation) can support immune function.\n    *   **Garlic and Ginger:** Incorporate these into your cooking (e.g., in soups or teas) for their potential anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.\n\n---\n\n### Foods to Avoid:\n\n1.  **Irritating Foods:**\n    *   **Spicy Foods:** Can irritate a sore throat and potentially trigger coughing.\n    *   **Acidic Foods:** Highly acidic foods like citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, limes) and tomatoes (especially raw or in highly concentrated sauces) can worsen a sore throat for some individuals. Observe your own tolerance.\n    *   **Crunchy or Hard Foods:** Chips, crackers, toast, raw vegetables, and nuts can scratch or irritate a sore throat.\n    *   **Very Hot or Very Cold Foods/Drinks:** Extreme temperatures can sometimes be irritating. Aim for lukewarm or room temperature.\n\n2.  **Dehydrating & Inflammatory Foods:**\n    *   **Alcohol:** Dehydrating and can suppress the immune system.\n    *   **Caffeine:** Can be dehydrating and interfere with much-needed sleep.\n    *   **Excessive Sugar and Processed Foods:** These offer little nutritional value, can contribute to inflammation, and may hinder your body's recovery.\n    *   **Fried and Greasy Foods:** Can be difficult to digest and may cause stomach upset.\n\n3.  **Dairy (Observe Personal Reaction):**\n    *   Some people find that dairy products (milk, cheese) can thicken mucus, which might worsen congestion or a cough. If you notice this effect, consider reducing dairy intake temporarily. Yogurt, however, is often well-tolerated due to its probiotic content.\n\n---\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\nThis dietary guidance is general in nature and designed to support your body's recovery from common viral symptoms. It is **not a replacement for personalized advice from a registered dietitian or your doctor.** Always follow your doctor's recommendations, especially if your symptoms change, worsen, or if you have any underlying health conditions.

However, if you feel a very slight improvement in energy and your symptoms are not worsening, you may consider the following **extremely low-intensity, gentle movements.** These should be approached with extreme caution and stopped immediately if you feel any discomfort.\n\n1.  **Short, Slow, Gentle Walks:**\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes maximum.\n    *   **Intensity:** Very slow pace, like a leisurely stroll.\n    *   **Environment:** Consider walking around your home or in a quiet, flat outdoor area if the weather is mild and air quality is good. Avoid crowded places.\n    *   **Focus:** Gentle movement, fresh air (if outdoors), and a change of scenery. This is not about getting your heart rate up, but about very light circulation.\n\n2.  **Gentle Stretching or Mobility Exercises:**\n    *   **Type:** Focus on very slow, static stretches for major muscle groups (e.g., neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, gentle arm circles, light hamstring stretches).\n    *   **Intensity:** No bouncing, no deep stretches that cause strain. Move only within a comfortable range of motion.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes total.\n    *   **Focus:** Maintaining some flexibility and easing any stiffness from resting.\n\n3.  **Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n    *   **Type:** Simple diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing). Lie down or sit comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise. Exhale slowly through pursed lips, feeling your belly fall.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes.\n    *   **Focus:** Promoting relaxation, improving lung capacity gently, and calming the nervous system.

If you don't feel up to even these gentle activities, then rest is the best choice.\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Continue to sip on water or herbal teas before, during, and after any activity.\n\n---\n\n### Activities to Avoid Completely:\n\n*   **Any moderate to high-intensity exercise:** This includes running, jogging, cycling, swimming laps, weightlifting, HIIT, group fitness classes, or any activity that significantly raises your heart rate or makes you breathe heavily.\n*   **Activities that require significant exertion or could lead to falls:** This includes sports, intense yoga, or anything that puts stress on your body.\n\n---\n\n### Returning to Your Regular Fitness Routine:\n\n*   **Wait Until Symptoms Fully Resolve:** Do not attempt to return to your normal exercise routine until your sore throat, runny nose, cough, and fatigue have completely disappeared for at least 24-48 hours.\n*   **Gradual Reintroduction:** When you do feel ready, start very slowly and gradually increase intensity and duration over several days or even a week. Begin with light activities like walking, and slowly reintroduce more challenging exercises.\n*   **Consult Your Doctor:** Before resuming any heavy exercise, especially after an illness, it's always a good idea to check in with your doctor to ensure you are fully recovered and ready.\n\nYour health and recovery are the priority right now.

Think soups, smoothies, steamed vegetables, and soft fruits.\n    *   **Support Immune Function:** Include foods rich in Vitamin C (citrus, berries, bell peppers) and Zinc (nuts, seeds, legumes, lean meats).\n    *   **Avoid Irritants:** Steer clear of very spicy, acidic, or crunchy foods that might irritate your sore throat. Processed foods and excessive sugar can also be counterproductive to recovery.\n\n3.  **Gentle Movement (Listen to Your Body):**\n    *   **Rest is Paramount:** Your body is working hard to recover, so prioritize rest over strenuous activity.\n    *   **Light Activity Only:** If you feel up to it, very gentle activities like short, slow walks (10-15 minutes) or light stretching can be beneficial for circulation and mood, but stop immediately if you feel more fatigued or symptoms worsen.\n    *   **Avoid Strenuous Exercise:** High-intensity workouts or heavy lifting should be completely avoided until your symptoms have fully resolved and your energy levels return to normal. Pushing yourself can prolong recovery.\n\n4.  **Personal Hygiene:**\n    *   **Frequent Handwashing:** Wash your hands thoroughly and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose.\n    *   **Cough and Sneeze Etiquette:** Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, or use the inside of your elbow. Dispose of tissues immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Sleep Hygiene: Prioritizing Rest for Recovery\n\n1.  **Prioritize Sleep:**\n    *   **Aim for 7-9 Hours (or More):** Your body needs extra rest to fight off illness. Go to bed earlier than usual and allow yourself to sleep in if possible.\n    *   **Listen to Fatigue Cues:** If you feel tired during the day, allow yourself short naps (20-30 minutes) to recharge, but avoid long naps that might disrupt nighttime sleep.\n\n2.  **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:**\n    *   **Dark, Quiet, Cool:** Ensure your bedroom is conducive to sleep. Block out light, minimize noise, and keep the temperature comfortably cool (around 60-67\u00b0F or 15-19\u00b0C).\n    *   **Elevate Your Head:** If nasal congestion or cough is bothering you, try sleeping with an extra pillow to elevate your head slightly, which can help with drainage and reduce post-nasal drip.\n\n3.  **Pre-Sleep Routine:**\n    *   **Wind Down:** Engage in relaxing activities before bed, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath or shower (steam can help with congestion), or listening to calming music.\n    *   **Limit Screens:** Avoid bright screens (phones, tablets, computers, TV) for at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light can interfere with melatonin production.\n\n---\n\n### Stress Management: Easing the Mental Load\n\n1.  **Acknowledge and Accept:**\n    *   **Be Kind to Yourself:** It's okay to feel unwell and to slow down. Acknowledge that your body needs time to heal, and don't feel guilty about resting.\n    *   **Listen to Your Body's Signals:** Pay attention to fatigue and other symptoms, and adjust your activities accordingly.\n\n2.  **Simplify and Delegate:**\n    *   **Reduce Commitments:** If possible, postpone non-essential tasks, social engagements, and work deadlines. Communicate your situation to others.\n    *   **Ask for Help:** Don't hesitate to ask family, friends, or colleagues for support with daily chores or responsibilities.\n\n3.  **Mindfulness and Relaxation:**\n    *   **Gentle Breathing Exercises:** Practice slow, deep breathing for a few minutes several times a day. This can help calm your nervous system.\n    *   **Light Meditation/Mindfulness:** Even 5-10 minutes of guided meditation or simply focusing on your breath can reduce stress.\n    *   **Engage in Calming Hobbies:** If you have the energy, gentle activities like reading, listening to music, or light crafting can be soothing.\n\n---\n\n### Daily Routine Tips: Adapting for Recovery\n\n1.  **Pace Yourself:**\n    *   **Break Down Tasks:** If you must do something, break it into smaller, manageable chunks with rest periods in between.\n    *   **Prioritize:** Focus only on the most essential tasks and let go of the rest for now.\n\n2.  **Schedule Rest Periods:**\n    *   **Build in Downtime:** Intentionally schedule periods of rest throughout your day, even if it's just sitting quietly or lying down for 15-30 minutes.\n    *   **Avoid Over-Scheduling:** Do not fill your day with too many activities, even light ones.\n\n3.  **Maintain a Sense of Normalcy (Gently):**\n    *   **Consistent Wake-Up Time (Mostly):** While extra sleep is good, try not to drastically alter your wake-up time by more than an hour or two, even on weekends, to help maintain your circadian rhythm.\n    *   **Fresh Air (If Possible):** If the weather permits and you feel up to it, step outside for a few minutes of fresh air and natural light, which can boost mood and help regulate sleep.\n\n4.  **Environmental Comfort:**\n    *   **Humidifier:** Use a cool-mist humidifier in your bedroom, especially at night, to help soothe your sore throat and ease congestion.\n    *   **Warm Compresses/Showers:** A warm, steamy shower can help clear nasal passages and soothe a cough.\n\n---\n\n**Important Constraint:**\n*   **Avoid Spreading Illness:** If you are feeling unwell, it's best to limit close contact with others, especially vulnerable individuals, to prevent the spread of any potential illness. Work from home if possible, and avoid public gatherings.\n\nRemember, these suggestions are designed to support your body's natural healing process. Listen carefully to your body, and if your symptoms worsen or do not improve, please consult a healthcare professional.",

      "fitness": "Given your current symptoms of a mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and evening fatigue, and the doctor's suspicion of a viral infection, your body is actively working to recover. The excellent dietary and lifestyle advice you've received emphasizes rest and gentle nourishment, which are your top priorities right now.\n\nAs a cautious fitness coach, my primary recommendation for physical activity during this time is **rest**. Pushing yourself when your body is fighting an infection can prolong your recovery or even worsen your symptoms.\n\nHowever, if you feel a very slight improvement in energy and absolutely no worsening of symptoms, here are some extremely low-risk, gentle activities you *might* consider. **It is crucial to listen intently to your body and stop immediately if you feel any pain, discomfort, increased fatigue, dizziness, or any worsening of your symptoms.**\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Low-Risk, Gentle Physical Activities:\n\n1.  **Short, Slow Walks (Outdoors if possible):**\n    *   **Activity:** A very gentle stroll, ideally in fresh air if the weather permits and you're not exposing others.\n    *   **Duration:** Start with just **5-10 minutes**. If you feel absolutely fine, you *might* extend to 15 minutes, but err on the side of caution.\n    *   **Intensity:** This should feel like a leisurely walk, not exercise. You should be able to hold a full conversation without any breathlessness.\n    *   **Focus:** Enjoy the change of scenery, get some natural light, and promote very mild circulation.\n    *   **Stop if:** You feel more tired, your cough worsens, your throat feels more irritated, or you experience any discomfort.\n\n2.  **Gentle Stretching / Mobility Exercises:**\n    *   **Activity:** Slow, deliberate stretches focusing on major muscle groups, performed while seated or lying down.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Neck Rolls:** Gently roll your head from side to side, ear towards shoulder.\n        *   **Shoulder Rolls:** Roll shoulders forward and backward.\n        *   **Arm Stretches:** Gently extend arms overhead or across your body.\n        *   **Cat-Cow Stretch (Modified):** On hands and knees, gently arch and round your back, moving slowly. If this feels too much, skip it.\n        *   **Leg Swings (Gentle):** While holding onto support, very gently swing one leg forward and back, then side to side.\n        *   **Ankle Circles:** Rotate your ankles in both directions.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes, broken into short sessions if needed.\n    *   **Intensity:** No deep stretches, no holding stretches to the point of discomfort. Focus on gentle movement and increasing blood flow.\n    *   **Focus:** Maintain flexibility and ease tension without taxing your cardiovascular system.\n    *   **Stop if:** You feel any strain, pain, dizziness, or increased fatigue.\n\n3.  **Diaphragmatic Breathing (Belly Breathing):**\n    *   **Activity:** Lie down or sit comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise more than your chest. Exhale slowly through pursed lips.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes, several times a day.\n    *   **Intensity:** Very low. This is a relaxation technique.\n    *   **Focus:** Promote relaxation, improve lung function gently, and calm your nervous system.\n    *   **Stop if:** You feel lightheaded or your cough is triggered.\n\n---\n\n**Crucial Warnings and Constraints:**\n\n*   **Listen to Your Body ABOVE ALL ELSE:** This is the most important rule. Your body is sending you signals of fatigue for a reason. Respect them.\n*   **No \"Pushing Through\":** This is not the time to challenge yourself or try to maintain your usual fitness routine. Any activity should feel easy and restorative.\n*   **Avoid Strenuous Exercise:** Absolutely no high-intensity interval training (HIIT), heavy lifting, running, vigorous sports, or any activity that significantly raises your heart rate or makes you breathe hard. This can worsen your condition and prolong recovery.\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Continue to drink plenty of fluids before, during, and after any gentle activity.\n*   **Stop Immediately:** If you experience any pain, discomfort, increased fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening of your cough or sore throat, **stop the activity immediately and rest.**\n\n---\n\n**When to Consult a Doctor (Again):**\n\n*   If your symptoms worsen, new symptoms develop, or you experience any concerning signs during or after gentle activity.\n*   **Before resuming any moderate to heavy exercise, please consult your doctor.** They can advise you on when it's safe to gradually return to your regular fitness routine, ensuring your body has fully recovered.\n\nFor now, prioritize rest, hydration, and nourishing foods. Your body will thank you for it.",

Your body needs energy to fight off whatever is causing your symptoms.\n    *   **Gentle Walks:** If you feel up to it, a short, gentle walk outdoors (if the weather permits and you're not feeling too chilled) can help with circulation and mood, but don't push yourself.\n    *   **Stretching:** Simple, gentle stretches can help ease tension without expending too much energy.\n\n4.  **Hygiene Practices:**\n    *   **Frequent Handwashing:** Wash your hands thoroughly and often with soap and water, especially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose.\n    *   **Cover Coughs and Sneezes:** Use a tissue or your elbow to cover your mouth and nose to prevent spreading germs.\n    *   **Avoid Touching Face:** Try to avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth to prevent germ transmission.\n\n### Sleep Hygiene\n\n1.  **Prioritize Rest:**\n    *   **Aim for Extra Sleep:** Given your fatigue, especially in the evening, make sleep your top priority. Aim for 8-10 hours of sleep per night, and consider short naps (20-30 minutes) if needed during the day, but avoid long naps that might disrupt nighttime sleep.\n    *   **Consistent Sleep Schedule (as much as possible):** Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on weekends, to regulate your body's internal clock.\n\n2.  **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:**\n    *   **Dark, Quiet, Cool:** Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and kept at a comfortable, cool temperature.\n    *   **Humidifier:** A cool-mist humidifier can help soothe a dry cough and sore throat by adding moisture to the air.\n    *   **Elevate Your Head:** If your cough or runny nose is worse when lying flat, try propping your head up with an extra pillow to help with drainage and ease breathing.\n\n3.  **Pre-Sleep Routine:**\n    *   **Wind-Down Activities:** Engage in relaxing activities before bed, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath or shower, or listening to calming music.\n    *   **Limit Screen Time:** Avoid screens (phones, tablets, computers, TV) for at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light can interfere with melatonin production.\n\n### Stress Management\n\n1.  **Reduce Commitments:**\n    *   **Say No:** Don't be afraid to decline extra tasks or social engagements. Your body needs energy to recover, and over-scheduling can increase stress.\n    *   **Delegate if Possible:** If you have responsibilities, see if you can delegate or postpone them.\n\n2.  **Mindfulness and Relaxation:**\n    *   **Deep Breathing Exercises:** Practice slow, deep breaths for a few minutes several times a day. This can help calm your nervous system.\n    *   **Gentle Stretching or Yoga:** Simple, restorative stretches can release physical tension.\n    *   **Short Meditation:** Even 5-10 minutes of guided meditation can help reduce stress and promote relaxation.\n\n3.  **Connect (Cautiously):**\n    *   **Maintain Social Connection (Safely):** While you should avoid close contact to prevent spreading germs, a brief phone call or video chat with a supportive friend or family member can boost your mood and reduce feelings of isolation.\n\n### Daily Routine Tips\n\n1.  **Pace Yourself:**\n    *   **Breaks are Essential:** Break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and take frequent short breaks. Don't try to push through fatigue.\n    *   **Listen to Your Body's Signals:** If you feel tired, rest. If you feel a cough coming on, take a moment to recover.\n\n2.  **Warm Beverages Throughout the Day:**\n    *   Keep a thermos of warm water, herbal tea, or broth nearby to sip on regularly. This helps keep your throat moist and can provide comfort.\n\n3.  **Limit Exposure to Irritants:**\n    *   **Avoid Smoke:** Stay away from cigarette smoke and other airborne irritants that can worsen your cough and sore throat.\n    *   **Clean Air:** Ensure good ventilation in your living spaces.\n\n4.  **Plan for Recovery:**\n    *   **Stock Up:** Make sure you have essentials at home (tissues, fluids, easy-to-prepare meals) so you don't have to go out unnecessarily.\n    *   **Inform Others:** Let close contacts know you're not feeling well so they can be understanding if you need to cancel plans or take it easy.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you can support your body's natural healing process and manage your symptoms more effectively.

Avoid completely while recovering.\n\n3.  **Foods with Low Nutritional Value:**\n    *   **Highly Processed Foods:** Sugary snacks, candies, pastries, and fast food offer little nutritional benefit and can contribute to inflammation.\n    *   **Excessive Refined Sugars:** While a little honey in tea is fine, large amounts of added sugar can potentially suppress immune function.\n\n4.  **Dairy (Monitor Personal Response):**\n    *   Some people find that dairy products (milk, cheese) can thicken mucus, which might worsen a runny nose or cough. If you notice this, consider temporarily reducing dairy intake or opting for plant-based alternatives. However, for many, dairy is fine and can be a source of protein and calcium.\n\n---\n\nBy focusing on these gentle, nourishing, and hydrating foods, you can support your body's natural healing process and manage your symptoms more comfortably. Remember to rest as much as possible and continue to follow your doctor's advice.",
      "fitness": "Given your current symptoms of a mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and especially the fatigue, coupled with your doctor's suspicion of a viral infection, your body's priority is rest and recovery. As a cautious fitness coach, my primary recommendation is to **prioritize rest and avoid any strenuous physical activity.**\n\nYour body is working hard to fight off the infection, and diverting energy to exercise can hinder this process and potentially prolong your recovery or worsen your symptoms.\n\n**Here are my recommendations for physical activity during this time:**\n\n1.  **Complete Rest is Preferred:** For the next few days, especially while you're feeling fatigued, the best \"activity\" is often no activity at all. Allow your body to fully focus on healing. This means no structured workouts, no heavy lifting, and no intense cardio.\n\n2.  **Gentle Movement (Optional and with Extreme Caution):**\n    If you feel a slight improvement in your energy levels and your symptoms are not worsening, you *might* consider very brief, gentle movements. However, this is entirely optional, and you must be extremely vigilant about listening to your body.\n\n    *   **Short, Slow Walks:** If you feel up to it, a very short (5-10 minute) and slow walk around your home or in a very mild outdoor environment (avoiding cold, wind, or extreme heat) can help with circulation and mood. This is not about getting your heart rate up; it's about gentle movement.\n        *   **Crucial Constraint:** If you feel any increase in cough, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fatigue, **stop immediately.**\n\n    *   **Gentle Stretching or Mobility:** Simple, slow stretches that focus on easing tension rather than increasing flexibility or strength. Think gentle neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, or very light arm and leg stretches while seated or lying down.\n        *   **Crucial Constraint:** Avoid any stretches that cause pain, discomfort, or require significant effort. Do not hold stretches for too long.\n\n    *   **Deep Breathing Exercises:** These can be beneficial for respiratory comfort and relaxation. Sit comfortably and focus on slow, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling slowly through your mouth. This is not strenuous but can help with lung capacity and relaxation.\n\n**Activities to Absolutely Avoid:**\n\n*   **Any moderate to high-intensity cardiovascular exercise:** Running, jogging, cycling, swimming laps, brisk walking, or any activity that significantly raises your heart rate or makes you breathe heavily.\n*   **Strength training:** Lifting weights, bodyweight exercises (push-ups, squats, planks), or any resistance training.\n*   **High-impact activities:** Jumping, sports, or anything that jars your body.\n*   **Exercising in extreme temperatures:** Avoid very cold, hot, or humid environments.\n\n**Key Principles to Follow:**\n\n*   **Listen to Your Body Above All Else:** This is the most important rule. If you feel any pain, discomfort, increased fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, or worsening of your sore throat or cough, **stop immediately and rest.**\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Continue to follow the excellent hydration advice from the diet agent. This is vital for recovery.\n*   **Prioritize Sleep:** Adequate rest is your most powerful tool for recovery.\n*   **Do Not Push Yourself:** There is no benefit to pushing through illness. It will only prolong your recovery.\n\n**Always consult your doctor before resuming your regular exercise routine, especially after a viral infection.** They can advise you on when it's safe to gradually increase your activity levels. For now, focus on healing.",

      "lifestyle": "Given the mild symptoms of a sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and evening fatigue, here are some lifestyle changes and constraints to support your well-being and recovery:\n\n---\n\n### Lifestyle Habits:\n\n1.  **Hydration is Key:**\n    *   **Increase Fluid Intake:** Sip on warm water, herbal teas (like ginger or chamomile), clear broths, or water throughout the day. This helps soothe a sore throat, thin mucus, and prevent dehydration, which is crucial when feeling unwell.\n    *   **Avoid Dehydrating Drinks:** Limit caffeine and alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration and may interfere with sleep.\n\n2.  **Nourishing Foods:**\n    *   **Opt for Easy-to-Digest Meals:** Focus on nutrient-dense, soft, and warm foods like soups, stews, cooked vegetables, and fruits. These provide energy and support your immune system without taxing your digestive system.\n    *   **Listen to Your Appetite:** Don't force yourself to eat if you're not hungry, but try to get some nourishment in small, frequent portions.\n\n3.  **Gentle Movement (or Rest):**\n    *   **Prioritize Rest:** Your body is working to fight off whatever is causing your symptoms, so rest is paramount. Avoid strenuous physical activity.\n    *   **Light Activity if Tolerated:** If you feel up to it, very gentle activities like a short, slow walk outdoors (if weather permits and you're not feeling chilled) can be beneficial, but stop immediately if you feel worse.\n\n4.  **Personal Hygiene:**\n    *   **Frequent Handwashing:** Wash your hands thoroughly and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose, and before eating.\n    *   **Cover Coughs and Sneezes:** Use a tissue or your elbow to prevent the spread of germs.\n\n---\n\n### Sleep Hygiene:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Sleep:**\n    *   **Aim for Extra Sleep:** Your body needs more rest than usual to recover. Try to go to bed earlier and allow yourself to sleep in if possible.\n    *   **Listen to Your Body's Cues:** If you feel tired during the day, a short nap (20-30 minutes) can be restorative, but avoid long naps that might disrupt nighttime sleep.\n\n2.  **Create a Conducive Sleep Environment:**\n    *   **Dark, Quiet, Cool:** Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable, slightly cool temperature.\n    *   **Elevate Your Head (if needed):** If your cough or runny nose is worse when lying flat, try propping your head up with an extra pillow to help with drainage and ease breathing.\n\n3.  **Relaxing Bedtime Routine:**\n    *   **Wind Down:** Engage in calming activities before bed, such as reading a book, listening to soothing music, or taking a warm bath or shower (the steam can also help with congestion).\n    *   **Limit Screen Time:** Avoid bright screens (phones, tablets, computers, TV) for at least an hour before bed, as the blue light can interfere with melatonin production.\n\n---\n\n### Stress Management:\n\n1.  **Reduce Commitments:**\n    *   **Say \"No\" to Non-Essentials:** This is not the time to push yourself. Delegate tasks if possible, postpone non-urgent appointments, and reduce your workload.\n    *   **Manage Expectations:** Be kind to yourself and accept that your productivity might be lower than usual.\n\n2.  **Gentle Relaxation Techniques:**\n    *   **Deep Breathing:** Practice slow, deep breaths throughout the day. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. This can help calm your nervous system.\n    *   **Mindful Moments:** Take short breaks to simply sit quietly, focus on your senses, or listen to calming music.\n\n3.  **Connect (Safely):**\n    *   **Reach Out:** If you're feeling isolated or overwhelmed, connect with a trusted friend or family member via phone or video call. Sharing how you feel can be a stress reliever.\n    *   **Avoid Spreading Germs:** While connecting, be mindful of not exposing others to your symptoms.\n\n---\n\n### Daily Routine Tips:\n\n1.  **Pace Yourself:**\n    *   **Break Tasks into Smaller Chunks:** If you must do something, break it down and take frequent breaks.\n    *   **Listen to Your Energy Levels:** Pay attention to when you feel most fatigued (like in the evening) and plan your day accordingly, scheduling more rest during those times.\n\n2.  **Simplify and Prioritize:**\n    *   **Focus on Essentials:** Identify the absolute must-dos and let go of anything that can wait.\n    *   **Create a Flexible Schedule:** Allow for spontaneity and adjust your plans based on how you're feeling hour by hour.\n\n3.  **Maintain a Comfortable Environment:**\n    *   **Humidify the Air:** If you have a humidifier, use it in your bedroom or living space. Moist air can help soothe a dry cough and sore throat.\n    *   **Keep Warm:** Dress in layers and ensure your living space is comfortably warm, especially if you're feeling chilled.\n\n---\n\n**Important Constraint:** While these tips are designed to support your well-being, please remember that if your symptoms worsen, new concerning symptoms develop (e.g., difficulty breathing, high fever, severe pain), or if they do not improve within a few days, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional.",
      "diet": "Given your symptoms of a mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and evening fatigue, and the doctor's assessment of a suspected viral infection with no serious findings, the focus of your diet should be on supporting your immune system, providing energy, and soothing your symptoms.\n\nHere is a safe, balanced diet plan with foods to prefer and avoid:\n\n---\n\n### General Dietary Principles:\n\n*   **Hydration is Paramount:** Continue to prioritize fluid intake as recommended by the lifestyle agent. This is crucial for thinning mucus, soothing your throat, and preventing dehydration, especially when you're feeling unwell.\n*   **Nutrient Density:** Focus on foods that provide a good amount of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to support your body's recovery.\n*   **Easy to Digest:** Choose foods that are gentle on your digestive system, as your body is already working hard to fight off the infection.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Eat when you're hungry, and don't force yourself if your appetite is low. Small, frequent meals can be more manageable.\n\n---\n\n### Foods to Prefer:\n\n1.  **Hydrating Fluids:**\n    *   **Water:** Plain, filtered water is always best.\n    *   **Herbal Teas:** Warm teas like ginger, chamomile, peppermint, or licorice root can be very soothing for a sore throat and cough. Add a spoonful of honey for extra soothing properties (for adults).\n    *   **Clear Broths/Soups:** Chicken or vegetable broth, or light soups (like chicken noodle soup with soft noodles and vegetables) are excellent for hydration and provide electrolytes and nutrients.\n    *   **Diluted Fruit Juices:** Opt for 100% fruit juice diluted with water, especially those rich in Vitamin C (e.g., orange, apple).\n    *   **Electrolyte Drinks:** If you're feeling particularly run down or have a poor appetite, consider an oral rehydration solution or coconut water in moderation.\n\n2.  **Soothing & Easy-to-Digest Foods:**\n    *   **Soft Fruits:** Bananas, cooked apples (applesauce), pears, melons, and berries are easy to eat and provide vitamins and antioxidants.\n    *   **Cooked Vegetables:** Steamed or boiled carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, and other leafy greens are packed with nutrients and easy to digest.\n    *   **Oatmeal/Porridge:** Warm, comforting, and easy to swallow.

Add it to tea or warm water.\n\n3.  **Immune-Boosting & Energy-Providing Foods:**\n    *   **Vitamin C-Rich Foods:** Citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruits), bell peppers, strawberries, kiwi, and broccoli.\n    *   **Zinc-Rich Foods:** Lean meats (chicken, turkey), lentils, beans, nuts (if tolerated), and whole grains.\n    *   **Lean Proteins:** Chicken, turkey, fish (baked or steamed), tofu, and legumes. These provide amino acids essential for immune function.\n    *   **Whole Grains:** Brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat pasta (if soft), and whole grain bread (toasted lightly if preferred) for sustained energy.\n    *   **Healthy Fats:** Avocado, olive oil, and nuts/seeds (if tolerated and not irritating to the throat) provide energy and support overall health.\n\n---\n\n### Foods to Avoid or Limit:\n\n1.  **Dehydrating Beverages:**\n    *   **Alcohol:** Can dehydrate you and suppress your immune system.\n    *   **Excessive Caffeine:** While a small amount might be okay if you're used to it, too much can dehydrate you and interfere with sleep, which is crucial for recovery.\n\n2.  **Throat Irritants:**\n    *   **Spicy Foods:** Can irritate a sore throat and potentially worsen a cough.\n    *   **Acidic Foods:** Citrus juices (undiluted), tomatoes, and vinegar can irritate a sore throat.\n    *   **Very Crunchy or Hard Foods:** Chips, crackers, hard toast, or raw, tough vegetables can be abrasive to a sore throat.\n    *   **Very Hot or Very Cold Foods/Drinks:** Extreme temperatures can sometimes be irritating; aim for lukewarm or room temperature.\n\n3.  **Foods that May Suppress Immunity or are Hard to Digest:**\n    *   **Highly Processed Foods:** Sugary snacks, fast food, and pre-packaged meals often lack nutrients and can be harder for your body to process.\n    *   **Excessive Sugar:** High sugar intake can potentially dampen immune response.\n    *   **Greasy/Fried Foods:** These can be heavy on the digestive system and may not provide optimal nutrients for recovery.\n    *   **Dairy (if it thickens mucus):** Some people find dairy products (milk, cheese) can temporarily thicken mucus, which might worsen congestion. If you notice this, consider reducing dairy intake temporarily.\n\n---\n\n### Sample Day Plan (Adjust portions and timing to your appetite):\n\n*   **Breakfast:** Warm oatmeal with sliced banana and a drizzle of honey, or scrambled eggs with a side of soft, cooked spinach. Herbal tea.\n*   **Mid-Morning Snack:** A small bowl of applesauce or a few slices of melon.\n*   **Lunch:** Chicken noodle soup (with plenty of broth and soft vegetables) or a small portion of baked fish with mashed sweet potato.

      "fitness": "As your cautious fitness coach, given your mild symptoms (sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and evening fatigue) and the doctor's suspected viral infection with no serious findings, our primary focus is on rest and gentle support for your body's recovery.\n\n**Your body is currently working hard to fight off an infection, so rest is paramount.** Pushing yourself too hard can prolong your recovery or even worsen your symptoms.\n\n---\n\n### Low-Risk, Gentle Physical Activities (Proceed with Extreme Caution):\n\nIf you feel a *slight* improvement in your energy levels and your symptoms remain mild and *above the neck* (sore throat, runny nose, dry cough), you *might* consider very light activity. However, the fatigue, especially in the evening, is a strong indicator that your body needs rest.\n\n**Always prioritize listening to your body. If you feel any pain, discomfort, increased fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, or any worsening of your symptoms, STOP IMMEDIATELY.**\n\n1.  **Gentle Walking:**\n    *   **Recommendation:** A very short, slow walk, perhaps 10-15 minutes, either indoors or in mild weather.\n    *   **Focus:** This is not about getting your heart rate up or breaking a sweat. It's about very light movement to prevent stiffness and get a change of scenery.\n    *   **Caution:** If you feel any increased fatigue, shortness of breath, or your cough worsens, turn back immediately. Avoid crowded areas to prevent spreading germs.\n\n2.  **Restorative Stretching / Gentle Mobility:**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Slow, gentle stretches focusing on major muscle groups, or simple mobility exercises. Think about movements like neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, gentle arm circles, or very light leg swings.\n    *   **Focus:** Aim for relaxation and easing any tension, not deep stretches or pushing into discomfort. Avoid any inversions or poses that put pressure on your head or chest.\n    *   **Caution:** Do not hold stretches for long periods if it feels uncomfortable. Move slowly and deliberately.\n\n3.  **Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Simple diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing) or box breathing.\n    *   **Focus:** This can help calm your nervous system, improve lung capacity gently, and promote relaxation.\n    *   **How-to:** Sit or lie comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise. Exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your belly fall. Repeat for 5-10 minutes.\n    *   **Caution:** If breathing causes coughing or discomfort, stop.\n\n---\n\n### Activities to **ABSOLUTELY AVOID** at this time:\n\n*   **Any moderate to high-intensity exercise:** This includes running, cycling, weightlifting, HIIT, intense yoga, or any activity that significantly raises your heart rate or makes you breathe heavily.\n*   **Team sports or competitive activities:** These can be too strenuous and also risk spreading your illness to others.\n*   **Exercising in extreme temperatures:** Avoid very hot or very cold environments.\n\n---\n\n### Crucial Safety Reminders:\n\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** This is the most important advice. Your body is sending you clear signals of fatigue, especially in the evening. Respect these signals and prioritize rest.\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Continue to drink plenty of fluids as recommended by the diet and lifestyle agents.\n*   **No Heavy Exercise:** As a cautious fitness coach, I must strongly advise against any heavy exercise while you are experiencing symptoms and fatigue. Your body needs its energy to recover.\n*   **Consult Your Doctor:** **Always recommend consulting a doctor before resuming or starting heavy exercise, especially after an illness.** If your symptoms worsen, new symptoms develop, or if you have any concerns about exercising, please consult your healthcare provider. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific health status.",

This is not about getting your heart rate up, but about light circulation and mental well-being.\n    *   **Constraint:** Avoid hills, brisk walking, or any pace that makes you feel winded or increases your cough.\n\n2.  **Gentle Stretching:**\n    *   **Activity:** Focus on static stretches that gently lengthen your muscles, particularly in your neck, shoulders, back, and legs.\n    *   **Intensity:** No bouncing, no forcing. Stretch only to the point of mild tension, never pain.\n    *   **Duration:** Hold each stretch for 15-30 seconds. A total session of 5-10 minutes is ample.\n    *   **Focus:** Improve flexibility and relieve any stiffness from resting.\n    *   **Constraint:** Avoid any stretches that put pressure on your throat or chest, or that make you cough.\n\n3.  **Restorative Yoga or Tai Chi (Very Modified):**\n    *   **Activity:** If you are familiar with these practices, choose very gentle, slow-moving, and low-impact poses or forms. Focus on breathing and gentle movement.\n    *   **Intensity:** The goal is relaxation and gentle mobility, not strength or endurance.\n    *   **Duration:** 10-15 minutes.\n    *   **Focus:** Mind-body connection, gentle movement, and controlled breathing.\n    *   **Constraint:** Avoid any inversions, strenuous poses, or anything that requires significant effort or breath holding. If you're new to these, it's best to stick to walking and stretching.\n\n4.  **Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n    *   **Activity:** Sit or lie comfortably. Inhale slowly through your nose, allowing your belly to rise. Exhale slowly through your mouth.\n    *   **Intensity:** Very low.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes, several times a day.\n    *   **Focus:** Can help clear airways, promote relaxation, and improve lung function gently.\n    *   **Constraint:** If deep breathing triggers coughing, reduce the depth or duration, or pause the exercise.\n\n---\n\n### Crucial Safety Guidelines:\n\n*   **STOP IMMEDIATELY:** If you experience any increase in your cough, sore throat, runny nose, fatigue, headache, dizziness, chest discomfort, or any new pain, stop the activity at once. Your body is telling you it needs more rest.\n*   **Hydrate:** Ensure you are well-hydrated before, during, and after any activity, even gentle ones.\n*   **Dress Appropriately:** Wear comfortable clothing and ensure you are not getting chilled or overheated.\n*   **No Pushing:** This is not the time to challenge yourself or try to \"sweat it out.\" The goal is gentle movement, not exertion.\n*   **Prioritize Rest:** If you feel tired, choose rest over activity. Rest is the most effective \"exercise\" for recovery right now.\n\n---\n\n**Always remember to consult your doctor before engaging in any heavy exercise, especially while recovering from an illness. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve, please contact your healthcare provider.**",

The primary goal of these lifestyle suggestions is to support your immune system, manage symptoms, and promote recovery without overexertion.\n\nHere are some simple lifestyle habits, sleep hygiene, stress management, and daily routine tips, keeping safety and your current symptoms in mind:\n\n---\n\n### General Lifestyle Habits:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Hydration:** As emphasized by the diet agent, continue to drink plenty of fluids throughout the day. Warm water, herbal teas, clear broths, and diluted juices are excellent choices. Hydration helps soothe your throat, thin mucus, and prevent dehydration.\n2.  **Follow Dietary Guidance:** Adhere to the \"Foods to Prefer\" list from the diet agent, focusing on nutrient-dense, easy-to-digest, and soothing foods. Avoid or limit the \"Foods to Avoid\" to prevent irritation and support your immune system.\n3.  **Practice Excellent Hygiene:**\n    *   **Hand Washing:** Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose.\n    *   **Cover Coughs/Sneezes:** Use a tissue or your elbow to cover your mouth and nose. Dispose of tissues immediately.\n    *   **Avoid Touching Face:** Try not to touch your eyes, nose, and mouth to prevent germ transmission.\n4.  **Avoid Irritants:** Steer clear of smoke (including secondhand smoke), strong chemical fumes, or very dusty environments, as these can further irritate your throat and respiratory passages.\n5.  **Gentle Movement (as advised by fitness agent):** If you feel up to it, very light, gentle activities like short, slow walks or restorative stretching can be beneficial, but **always stop if you feel any discomfort or increased fatigue.** Your body needs rest more than exercise right now.\n\n---\n\n### Sleep Hygiene:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Rest:** Your evening fatigue is a clear sign your body needs more sleep. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night, and don't feel guilty about taking naps during the day if needed.\n2.  **Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule (as much as possible):** Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on weekends, to regulate your body's internal clock.\n3.  **Create a Comfortable Sleep Environment:** Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool (around 60-67\u00b0F or 15-19\u00b0C). Use a humidifier if the air is dry, as this can help soothe a sore throat and cough.\n4.  **Avoid Stimulants Before Bed:** Limit caffeine and alcohol, especially in the hours leading up to bedtime, as they can disrupt sleep. The diet agent also advises against these.\n5.  **Wind-Down Routine:** Engage in relaxing activities before bed, such as reading a book, listening to calming music, or taking a warm bath/shower. Avoid screens (phones, tablets, computers, TV) for at least an hour before sleep.\n\n---\n\n### Stress Management:\n\n1.  **Practice Gentle Relaxation Techniques:**\n    *   **Deep Breathing:** As suggested by the fitness agent, practice diaphragmatic breathing for 5-10 minutes. This can calm your nervous system.\n    *   **Mindfulness/Meditation:** Even a few minutes of guided meditation or simply focusing on your breath can help reduce stress.\n    *   **Gentle Stretching:** Very light, slow stretches can release physical tension.\n2.  **Limit Stressors:** If possible, reduce exposure to news, social media, or work-related stressors that might increase anxiety.\n3.  **Engage in Calming Hobbies:** Listen to soothing music, read a light book, or engage in a gentle hobby that brings you peace.\n4.  **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. It's okay to slow down and not be productive when you're feeling unwell. Allow your body the time and space it needs to heal.\n\n---\n\n### Daily Routine Tips:\n\n1.  **Pace Yourself:** Break down any necessary tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Don't try to do too much at once.\n2.  **Schedule Rest Periods:** Intentionally build short rest breaks into your day, even if it's just sitting quietly for 15-20 minutes.\n3.  **Get Fresh Air (if weather permits):** If the weather is mild, a short period of sitting by an open window or a very brief, gentle walk outdoors can be refreshing. Avoid extreme temperatures.\n4.  **Stay Connected (Safely):** While you should avoid close contact to prevent spreading germs, a phone call or video chat with a friend or family member can help combat feelings of isolation.\n5.  **Listen to Your Body's Cues:** This is the most important tip. If you feel tired, rest. If you feel hungry, eat. If something feels uncomfortable, stop. Your body is your best guide during recovery.\n\n---\n\n**Important Constraints & Safety Reminders:**\n\n*   **No Strenuous Activity:** As advised by the fitness agent, **absolutely avoid any moderate to high-intensity exercise.** Your body needs its energy for healing.\n*   **Avoid Over-scheduling:** Do not try to push through your fatigue. Cancel or postpone non-essential commitments.\n*   **Prevent Spreading Germs:** Limit close contact with others, especially vulnerable individuals, to prevent transmitting your illness.\n*   **Monitor Symptoms:** If your symptoms worsen, you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, severe pain, or any other concerning symptoms, please consult a doctor immediately.\n\nBy implementing these gentle lifestyle adjustments, you can create an optimal environment for your body to recover and feel better soon.",
      "diet": "Given your symptoms of a mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and evening fatigue, and the doctor's assessment of a suspected viral infection with no serious findings, the focus of your diet should be on supporting your immune system, providing energy, and soothing your symptoms.\n\nHere is a safe, balanced diet plan with foods to prefer and avoid:\n\n---\n\n### General Dietary Principles:\n\n*   **Hydration is Paramount:** Continue to prioritize fluid intake as recommended by the lifestyle agent. This is crucial for thinning mucus, soothing your throat, and preventing dehydration, especially when you're feeling unwell.\n*   **Nutrient Density:** Focus on foods that provide a good amount of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to support your body's recovery.\n*   **Easy to Digest:** Choose foods that are gentle on your digestive system, as your body is already working hard to fight off the infection.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Eat when you're hungry, and don't force yourself if your appetite is low. Small, frequent meals can be more manageable.\n\n---\n\n### Foods to Prefer:\n\n1.  **Hydrating Fluids:**\n    *   **Water:** Plain, filtered water is always best.\n    *   **Herbal Teas:** Warm teas like ginger, chamomile, peppermint, or licorice root can be very soothing for a sore throat and cough. Add a spoonful of honey for extra soothing properties (for adults).\n    *   **Clear Broths/Soups:** Chicken or vegetable broth, or light soups (like chicken noodle soup with soft noodles and vegetables) are excellent for hydration and provide electrolytes and nutrients.\n    *   **Diluted Fruit Juices:** Opt for 100% fruit juice diluted with water, especially those rich in Vitamin C (e.g., orange, apple).\n    *   **Electrolyte Drinks:** If you're feeling particularly run down or have a poor appetite, consider an oral rehydration solution or coconut water in moderation.\n\n2.  **Soothing & Easy-to-Digest Foods:**\n    *   **Soft Fruits:** Bananas, cooked apples (applesauce), pears, melons, and berries are easy to eat and provide vitamins and antioxidants.\n    *   **Cooked Vegetables:** Steamed or boiled carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, and other leafy greens are packed with nutrients and easy to digest.\n    *   **Oatmeal/Porridge:** Warm, comforting, and easy to swallow. You can add a little honey or fruit.\n    *   **Mashed Potatoes/Sweet Potatoes:** Plain or with a little butter/olive oil.\n    *   **Scrambled Eggs:** A good source of protein that's easy to chew and digest.\n    *   **Yogurt/Kefir:** Plain, unsweetened varieties can provide probiotics, which may support gut health and immunity.\n    *   **Honey:** A natural cough suppressant and throat soother (for adults and children over 1 year old). Add it to tea or warm water.\n\n3.  **Immune-Boosting & Energy-Providing Foods:**\n    *   **Vitamin C-Rich Foods:** Citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruits), bell peppers, strawberries, kiwi, and broccoli.\n    *   **Zinc-Rich Foods:** Lean meats (chicken, turkey), lentils, beans, nuts (if tolerated), and whole grains.\n    *   **Lean Proteins:** Chicken, turkey, fish (baked or steamed), tofu, and legumes. These provide amino acids essential for immune function.\n    *   **Whole Grains:** Brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat pasta (if soft), and whole grain bread (toasted lightly if preferred) for sustained energy.\n    *   **Healthy Fats:** Avocado, olive oil, and nuts/seeds (if tolerated and not irritating to the throat) provide energy and support overall health.\n\n---\n\n### Foods to Avoid or Limit:\n\n1.  **Dehydrating Beverages:**\n    *   **Alcohol:** Can dehydrate you and suppress your immune system.\n    *   **Excessive Caffeine:** While a small amount might be okay if you're used to it, too much can dehydrate you and interfere with sleep, which is crucial for recovery.\n\n2.  **Throat Irritants:**\n    *   **Spicy Foods:** Can irritate a sore throat and potentially worsen a cough.\n    *   **Acidic Foods:** Citrus juices (undiluted), tomatoes, and vinegar can irritate a sore throat.\n    *   **Very Crunchy or Hard Foods:** Chips, crackers, hard toast, or raw, tough vegetables can be abrasive to a sore throat.\n    *   **Very Hot or Very Cold Foods/Drinks:** Extreme temperatures can sometimes be irritating; aim for lukewarm or room temperature.\n\n3.  **Foods that May Suppress Immunity or are Hard to Digest:**\n    *   **Highly Processed Foods:** Sugary snacks, fast food, and pre-packaged meals often lack nutrients and can be harder for your body to process.\n    *   **Excessive Sugar:** High sugar intake can potentially dampen immune response.\n    *   **Greasy/Fried Foods:** These can be heavy on the digestive system and may not provide optimal nutrients for recovery.\n    *   **Dairy (if it thickens mucus):** Some people find dairy products (milk, cheese) can temporarily thicken mucus, which might worsen congestion. If you notice this, consider reducing dairy intake temporarily.\n\n---\n\n### Sample Day Plan (Adjust portions and timing to your appetite):\n\n*   **Breakfast:** Warm oatmeal with sliced banana and a drizzle of honey, or scrambled eggs with a side of soft, cooked spinach. Herbal tea.\n*   **Mid-Morning Snack:** A small bowl of applesauce or a few slices of melon.\n*   **Lunch:** Chicken noodle soup (with plenty of broth and soft vegetables) or a small portion of baked fish with mashed sweet potato.

However, the fatigue, especially in the evening, is a strong indicator that your body needs rest.\n\n**Always prioritize listening to your body. If you feel any pain, discomfort, increased fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, or any worsening of your symptoms, STOP IMMEDIATELY.**\n\n1.  **Gentle Walking:**\n    *   **Recommendation:** A very short, slow walk, perhaps 10-15 minutes, either indoors or in mild weather.\n    *   **Focus:** This is not about getting your heart rate up or breaking a sweat. It's about very light movement to prevent stiffness and get a change of scenery.\n    *   **Caution:** If you feel any increased fatigue, shortness of breath, or your cough worsens, turn back immediately.

Think about movements like neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, gentle arm circles, or very light leg swings.\n    *   **Focus:** Aim for relaxation and easing any tension, not deep stretches or pushing into discomfort. Avoid any inversions or poses that put pressure on your head or chest.\n    *   **Caution:** Do not hold stretches for long periods if it feels uncomfortable. Move slowly and deliberately.\n\n3.  **Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Simple diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing) or box breathing.\n    *   **Focus:** This can help calm your nervous system, improve lung capacity gently, and promote relaxation.\n    *   **How-to:** Sit or lie comfortably.

Your body is sending you clear signals of fatigue, especially in the evening. Respect these signals and prioritize rest.\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Continue to drink plenty of fluids as recommended by the diet and lifestyle agents.\n*   **No Heavy Exercise:** As a cautious fitness coach, I must strongly advise against any heavy exercise while you are experiencing symptoms and fatigue.

      "diet": "Given your mild symptoms of a sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and evening fatigue, and the doctor's assessment of a suspected viral infection with no serious findings, the focus of your diet should be on supporting your body's recovery, providing essential nutrients, and soothing your symptoms.\n\nHere is a safe and balanced diet plan, emphasizing foods that are easy to digest and can help you feel better:\n\n---\n\n### General Dietary Principles:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Hydration:** This is crucial for thinning mucus, soothing your throat, and preventing dehydration, especially with a runny nose and cough.\n2.  **Choose Nutrient-Dense Foods:** Your body needs vitamins, minerals, and energy to fight off infection and recover from fatigue.\n3.  **Opt for Easy-to-Digest Foods:** Avoid anything that might upset your stomach or further irritate your throat.\n4.  **Listen to Your Body:** Eat when you're hungry, but don't force yourself if you have a reduced appetite. Small, frequent meals might be easier to manage.\n\n---\n\n### Foods to Prefer:\n\n*   **Hydrating Liquids:**\n    *   **Water:** Plain, filtered water is always best.\n    *   **Herbal Teas:** Warm teas like ginger, chamomile, peppermint, or decaffeinated green tea can be very soothing for a sore throat and cough. Add a teaspoon of honey for extra relief (for adults and children over 1 year).\n    *   **Clear Broths:** Chicken, vegetable, or bone broth are excellent for hydration and provide some electrolytes and nutrients. They are also gentle on the stomach.\n    *   **Diluted Fruit Juices:** Apple or grape juice, diluted with water, can provide some energy and vitamins. Avoid highly acidic juices if they irritate your throat.\n    *   **Warm Lemon Water:** Can help soothe a sore throat and provide Vitamin C.\n*   **Soft & Soothing Foods:**\n    *   **Soups and Stews:** Especially those with soft vegetables and lean protein (e.g., chicken noodle soup, lentil soup, vegetable soup).\n    *   **Oatmeal or Cream of Wheat:** Warm, comforting, and easy to swallow. You can add a little honey or mashed banana.\n    *   **Mashed Potatoes or Sweet Potatoes:** Plain or with a little butter/broth.\n    *   **Yogurt:** Plain, unsweetened yogurt can be soothing and provides probiotics, which may support gut health.\n    *   **Smoothies:** Blend soft fruits (banana, berries), leafy greens (spinach), and a liquid base (water, milk, or plant-based milk) for a nutrient-packed, easy-to-consume meal.\n    *   **Scrambled Eggs:** A good source of protein that's easy to digest.\n    *   **Soft Fruits:** Bananas, cooked apples (applesauce), pears, melon.\n    *   **Well-Cooked Vegetables:** Steamed or boiled carrots, zucchini, squash, green beans.\n*   **Lean Proteins:**\n    *   **Chicken or Turkey:** Poached, baked, or shredded in soups.\n    *   **Fish:** Baked or steamed white fish (e.g., cod, tilapia).\n    *   **Tofu or Tempeh:** Soft and versatile, can be added to soups or stir-fries.\n*   **Whole Grains (in moderation, if tolerated):**\n    *   **Whole-wheat Toast:** Softened with a little butter or avocado.\n    *   **Brown Rice:** Well-cooked and soft.\n\n---\n\n### Foods to Avoid or Limit:\n\n*   **Sugary Drinks:** Sodas, fruit punches, and excessive fruit juice can be dehydrating and may suppress the immune system.\n*   **Excessive Caffeine:** While a small amount might be okay, too much caffeine can be dehydrating and interfere with sleep, which is vital for recovery.\n*   **Alcohol:** Highly dehydrating and can interfere with your body's healing process.\n*   **Spicy Foods:** Can irritate a sore throat and potentially worsen a cough.\n*   **Acidic Foods:** Citrus fruits (like oranges, grapefruit) and tomatoes can sometimes irritate a sore throat for some individuals. Listen to your body.\n*   **Hard, Crunchy, or Dry Foods:** Chips, crackers, raw hard vegetables, and very dry toast can be abrasive and irritate a sore throat.\n*   **Fried and Fatty Foods:** These can be harder to digest and may cause stomach upset.\n*   **Highly Processed Foods:** Often lack essential nutrients and can contain ingredients that may not support recovery.\n*   **Very Hot or Very Cold Foods/Drinks:** Extreme temperatures can sometimes irritate a sensitive throat. Aim for lukewarm or room temperature.\n*   **Dairy (Optional Consideration):** Some people find that dairy products can thicken mucus, which might worsen congestion or cough. If you notice this, consider reducing dairy intake temporarily. However, for many, dairy is a good source of nutrients and can be soothing.\n\n---\n\n### Sample Day Plan:\n\n*   **Breakfast:** Oatmeal with mashed banana and a drizzle of honey, or a fruit smoothie with yogurt. Herbal tea.\n*   **Mid-morning Snack:** A soft banana or a small bowl of plain yogurt.\n*   **Lunch:** Chicken noodle soup with soft vegetables, or scrambled eggs with a slice of soft whole-wheat toast.

      "fitness": "As a cautious fitness coach, my primary recommendation for you right now, given your mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and evening fatigue, is to **prioritize rest and recovery.** Your body is actively fighting off a suspected viral infection, and its energy needs to be directed towards healing, not strenuous activity.\n\nYou've already consulted a doctor, which is excellent. Always remember to **consult your doctor before engaging in any heavy exercise, or if your symptoms worsen, new symptoms develop, or you have any concerns about physical activity.**\n\nFor now, the goal is to maintain very gentle movement to support circulation without taxing your immune system or exacerbating your symptoms.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Low-Risk, Gentle Physical Activities:\n\n1.  **Gentle, Short Walks:**\n    *   **Activity:** If you feel up to it, take very short, slow walks around your home or in a very mild outdoor environment (e.g., your garden or a quiet street).\n    *   **Duration:** Start with just 5-10 minutes, once or twice a day.\n    *   **Pace:** Keep it very slow and comfortable. You should be able to talk normally without any breathlessness.\n    *   **Focus:** The aim is simply to move your body gently, not to get your heart rate up or break a sweat.\n\n2.  **Light Stretching and Mobility:**\n    *   **Activity:** Perform very gentle, static stretches focusing on major muscle groups (neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, arm circles, gentle leg stretches).\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes.\n    *   **Pace:** Slow and controlled. Hold each stretch for 15-20 seconds without bouncing.\n    *   **Focus:** Improve circulation and prevent stiffness from prolonged rest. Avoid any stretches that cause strain or discomfort.\n\n3.  **Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n    *   **Activity:** Practice slow, deep diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing). Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise, then exhale slowly through your mouth.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes, several times a day.\n    *   **Pace:** Very slow and mindful.\n    *   **Focus:** Can help with respiratory comfort, relaxation, and stress reduction.\n\n---\n\n### Crucial Constraints and Warnings:\n\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** This is the most important rule. Your body will tell you what it can handle.\n*   **Stop Immediately:** If you feel any **pain, discomfort, dizziness, increased fatigue, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or if your cough or sore throat worsens** during any activity, **stop immediately and rest.**\n*   **No Strenuous Activity:** Absolutely avoid any moderate to high-intensity exercise, heavy lifting, running, jumping, or anything that significantly raises your heart rate or makes you breathe hard. This includes intense cardio, strength training, or competitive sports.\n*   **Prioritize Rest:** If you feel fatigued, especially in the evening, choose rest over activity. Sleep is one of the most powerful tools for recovery.\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Continue to sip on warm fluids throughout the day, as recommended by the diet agent.\n*   **Avoid Chilling:** If you go outside for a walk, ensure you are dressed appropriately to avoid getting chilled, which could worsen your symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** Your current focus is on recovery. These gentle activities are meant to support your well-being, not to push your physical limits. Once your symptoms have fully resolved and you feel your energy levels are back to normal, you can gradually consider reintroducing your regular fitness routine, always starting slowly and listening to your body. **Always consult your doctor before resuming or starting any new exercise routine, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.**",

      "diet": "Given your symptoms of a mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and fatigue, and the doctor's assessment of a suspected viral infection with no serious findings, the focus of your diet should be on supporting your body's recovery, soothing symptoms, and providing gentle nourishment. This aligns well with the lifestyle suggestions already provided.\n\nHere is a safe, balanced diet plan, emphasizing foods to prefer and those to limit or avoid during this time:\n\n### General Dietary Principles for Mild Illness:\n\n*   **Hydration is Key:** Continue to prioritize fluids as suggested by the lifestyle agent.\n*   **Easy to Digest:** Choose foods that are gentle on your stomach and don't require a lot of energy to process.\n*   **Nutrient-Dense:** Focus on foods that provide vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to support your immune system.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Your appetite might fluctuate. Eat when you're hungry, but don't force yourself. Small, frequent meals might be easier than large ones.\n\n### Foods to Prefer:\n\n1.  **Hydrating & Soothing Liquids:**\n    *   **Warm Broths & Soups:** Chicken noodle soup, vegetable broth, or clear consomm\u00e9s are excellent. They provide fluids, electrolytes, and easily digestible nutrients.\n    *   **Herbal Teas:** Ginger, chamomile, peppermint, or licorice root teas can be soothing for a sore throat and cough. Add a teaspoon of honey (for adults and children over 1 year) for extra relief.\n    *   **Warm Water with Lemon & Honey:** A classic for soothing sore throats and providing a gentle vitamin C boost.\n    *   **Plain Water:** Continue to sip water throughout the day.\n    *   **Electrolyte Drinks (diluted):** If you feel particularly dehydrated or have a poor appetite, diluted electrolyte solutions can help replenish minerals.\n\n2.  **Soft, Easy-to-Eat Foods:**\n    *   **Cooked Grains:** Oatmeal, cream of wheat, plain rice, or soft pasta. These provide energy and are gentle on the digestive system.\n    *   **Soft Fruits:** Bananas, applesauce, melon, peaches, or berries (especially blended into a smoothie). They are rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and fiber.\n    *   **Cooked Vegetables:** Steamed carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, spinach, or green beans. Cook them until very tender for easier digestion.\n    *   **Lean, Soft Proteins:** Soft-boiled or scrambled eggs, baked or poached fish, or shredded chicken (especially in soup). These provide essential amino acids for recovery.\n    *   **Yogurt or Kefir:** Plain, unsweetened varieties can provide probiotics, which support gut health and, by extension, immune function.\n    *   **Honey:** A natural cough suppressant and throat soother (again, for adults and children over 1 year).\n\n### Foods to Limit or Avoid:\n\n1.  **Irritating & Abrasive Foods:**\n    *   **Spicy Foods:** Can irritate a sore throat and potentially worsen a cough.\n    *   **Acidic Foods:** While whole fruits like oranges are generally fine, highly acidic foods or juices (like concentrated orange juice or tomato sauce) might irritate a sensitive throat for some individuals.\n    *   **Crunchy/Hard Foods:** Chips, crackers, hard toast, raw tough vegetables, or nuts can be abrasive and uncomfortable on a sore throat.\n    *   **Very Hot or Very Cold Foods/Drinks:** Extreme temperatures can sometimes irritate a sensitive throat. Aim for lukewarm or room temperature.\n\n2.  **Hard-to-Digest & Inflammatory Foods:**\n    *   **Fried or Greasy Foods:** These are harder to digest and can sometimes cause stomach upset.\n    *   **Highly Processed Foods:** Often high in unhealthy fats, sugar, and artificial ingredients, which offer little nutritional value and can potentially contribute to inflammation.\n    *   **Excessive Sugar:** Sugary drinks, candies, and desserts can suppress the immune system and may contribute to inflammation.\n    *   **Alcohol:** Dehydrating and can interfere with sleep and immune function.\n    *   **Excessive Caffeine:** Can be dehydrating and interfere with restful sleep, which is crucial for recovery.\n\n3.  **Potential Mucus-Thickening Foods (Individual Sensitivity):**\n    *   **Dairy Products:** While not everyone experiences this, some people find that dairy products (milk, cheese) can temporarily thicken mucus. If you notice this effect, you might consider limiting them, but plain yogurt is often well-tolerated and beneficial.\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n*   **This is General Guidance:** This dietary advice is intended to support your body during a mild illness. It is not a substitute for personalized medical advice from your doctor or a registered dietitian.\n*   **Monitor Your Symptoms:** Continue to pay attention to how you feel. If your symptoms worsen, you develop new concerns, or your appetite significantly declines, please consult your doctor again.\n*   **No Cures:** Diet can support your body's natural healing process, but it does not cure viral infections.\n\nBy focusing on these gentle, nutrient-rich foods and avoiding potential irritants, you can help your body recover more comfortably.",

The key here is **extreme caution and listening intently to your body.**\n\n**Always remember to consult your doctor before resuming any heavy exercise, and especially if your symptoms worsen or you develop new concerns.**\n\nHere are some low-risk, gentle physical activities you *might* consider, but only if you feel genuinely up to it:\n\n### Gentle Movement Plan (Optional and Highly Cautious)\n\n**Important Guidelines Before Starting:**\n\n*   **Listen to Your Body ABOVE ALL ELSE:** This is the most crucial rule. If you feel any pain, discomfort, increased fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, or worsening of your sore throat, cough, or runny nose, **STOP IMMEDIATELY.**\n*   **Keep it Short:** Sessions should be very brief, no more than 5-10 minutes at a time.\n*   **Low Intensity Only:** The goal is gentle movement, not to raise your heart rate significantly or break a sweat. You should be able to hold a full conversation comfortably throughout the activity.\n*   **Hydrate:** Ensure you are well-hydrated before, during, and after any activity, as emphasized in the diet and lifestyle advice.\n*   **Warm-up/Cool-down:** For these gentle activities, a \"warm-up\" might simply be a few deep breaths, and a \"cool-down\" is just stopping.\n\n---\n\n**1. Gentle Walking (Indoors or Outdoors, if weather permits):**\n    *   **Activity:** A very slow, leisurely walk.\n    *   **Duration:** Start with 5 minutes. If you feel absolutely fine, you *might* extend to 10 minutes, but err on the side of caution.\n    *   **Pace:** A stroll, not a brisk walk. Imagine you're window shopping.\n    *   **Environment:** Choose a flat, safe surface. If outdoors, ensure the air quality is good and the temperature is comfortable. Avoid cold, damp, or windy conditions that could irritate your respiratory system.\n    *   **Focus:** Pay attention to your breathing. If it becomes labored or your cough worsens, stop.\n\n**2. Light Stretching / Mobility Exercises:**\n    *   **Activity:** Gentle, static stretches that focus on improving flexibility and easing tension, rather than building strength or pushing limits.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Neck Rolls:** Slowly roll your head from side to side, ear to shoulder.\n        *   **Shoulder Rolls:** Gently roll your shoulders forward and backward.\n        *   **Arm Stretches:** Reach one arm across your body, gently pulling with the other.\n        *   **Cat-Cow Stretch (on hands and knees):** Gently arch and round your back.\n        *   **Child's Pose:** A restful pose that gently stretches the back and hips.\n        *   **Leg Swings (gentle, controlled):** Slowly swing one leg forward and backward, keeping it low.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes.\n    *   **Pace:** Slow and controlled. Hold each stretch for 15-20 seconds, breathing deeply.\n    *   **Focus:** Move within a comfortable range of motion. Do not force any stretch or bounce. If any stretch causes pain or increases your cough, stop that specific movement.\n\n**3. Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n    *   **Activity:** Focused, slow, deep breaths. This isn't \"exercise\" in the traditional sense, but it's a beneficial physical activity for lung health and relaxation.\n    *   **How to:** Sit or lie comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise. Exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your belly fall.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes, several times a day.\n    *   **Focus:** This can help soothe your respiratory system, promote relaxation, and manage fatigue.\n\n---\n\n**Connecting to Your Overall Recovery:**\n\nThese gentle movements, if you choose to do them, should complement the other crucial aspects of your recovery:\n\n*   **Rest:** Continue to prioritize extra sleep and naps as advised by the lifestyle agent.\n*   **Hydration:** Keep sipping those warm liquids and water.\n*   **Nutrition:** Stick to the easy-to-digest, nutrient-rich foods recommended by the diet agent.\n\n**Your body's priority right now is healing.

However, it is always advisable to monitor your symptoms. You should **consider seeing a doctor** if your symptoms worsen, do not improve within a few days, or if you develop any new concerning symptoms (such as difficulty breathing, high fever, or severe pain).",
      "lifestyle": "Given the mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and fatigue, it sounds like your body is working hard to recover. Here are some simple lifestyle changes and constraints to support your well-being during this time:\n\n### Lifestyle Habits:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Hydration:**\n    *   **Sip Warm Liquids:** Herbal teas (like ginger, chamomile, or peppermint), warm water with lemon and honey, or clear broths can be very soothing for a sore throat and help with congestion.\n    *   **Drink Plenty of Water:** Keep a water bottle handy and sip throughout the day to stay well-hydrated. Avoid sugary drinks or excessive caffeine.\n2.  **Nourish Your Body:**\n    *   **Eat Gentle, Nutrient-Rich Foods:** Focus on easily digestible foods like soups, stews, steamed vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.\n    *   **Listen to Your Appetite:** Don't force yourself to eat if you're not hungry, but try to get some nutrients in.\n3.  **Gentle Movement (if comfortable):**\n    *   **Light Stretching or Walking:** If you feel up to it, a very short, gentle walk outdoors (if weather permits) or some light stretching can help with circulation and mood, but avoid anything strenuous.\n    *   **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel more fatigued, prioritize rest over movement.\n\n### Sleep Hygiene:\n\n1.  **Increase Rest:**\n    *   **Aim for Extra Sleep:** Your body needs more rest to recover. Try to go to bed earlier than usual and allow yourself to sleep in if possible.\n    *   **Consider Naps:** A short nap (20-30 minutes) in the afternoon can be beneficial if you feel particularly fatigued, but avoid long naps that might disrupt nighttime sleep.\n2.  **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:**\n    *   **Keep it Dark, Quiet, and Cool:** Ensure your bedroom is conducive to sleep.\n    *   **Elevate Your Head:** If congestion is bothering you, try sleeping with an extra pillow to elevate your head slightly, which can help with breathing.\n    *   **Humidifier:** A cool-mist humidifier in your bedroom can help soothe a dry cough and sore throat.\n\n### Stress Management:\n\n1.  **Practice Gentle Relaxation:**\n    *   **Deep Breathing:** Take a few slow, deep breaths throughout the day. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth.\n    *   **Mindful Moments:** Take short breaks to simply sit quietly, perhaps with a warm drink, and focus on the present moment without judgment.\n    *   **Listen to Calming Music or Podcasts:** Choose soothing sounds or gentle spoken content that doesn't require too much mental effort.\n2.  **Limit Overwhelm:**\n    *   **Reduce Screen Time:** Especially before bed, as blue light can interfere with sleep.\n    *   **Avoid Stressful News/Content:** During this time, protect your mental space from anything that might add to stress.\n\n### Daily Routine Tips:\n\n1.  **Pace Yourself:**\n    *   **Break Tasks into Smaller Chunks:** If you must do something, break it down and take frequent breaks.\n    *   **Prioritize and Delegate:** Focus only on essential tasks. If possible, ask for help with chores or responsibilities.\n2.  **Build in Rest Periods:**\n    *   **Schedule Downtime:** Intentionally block out time in your day for rest, even if it's just sitting quietly or lying down.\n    *   **Listen to Your Body's Signals:** If you feel fatigue creeping in, stop what you're doing and rest.\n3.  **Maintain Basic Hygiene:**\n    *   **Hand Washing:** Continue frequent hand washing to prevent spreading germs.\n    *   **Gargle with Saltwater:** For your sore throat, a simple saltwater gargle (1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt in 8 ounces of warm water) a few times a day can be very effective.\n\n### Constraints (What to Limit or Avoid):\n\n*   **Strenuous Physical Activity:** Avoid intense workouts or heavy lifting.\n*   **Over-scheduling:** Don't push yourself to attend non-essential social events or commitments.\n*   **Alcohol and Excessive Caffeine:** These can dehydrate you and interfere with sleep.\n*   **Smoking or Vaping:** These can irritate your throat and respiratory system further.\n*   **Exposure to Irritants:** Try to avoid strong perfumes, cleaning chemicals, or dusty environments that might worsen your cough or runny nose.\n\nRemember, the goal is to support your body's natural healing process. Be kind to yourself and allow for extra rest and self-care during this time. If your symptoms worsen or don't improve, please consider consulting a healthcare professional.",
      "diet": "Given your symptoms of a mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and fatigue, and the doctor's assessment of a suspected viral infection with no serious findings, the focus of your diet should be on supporting your body's recovery, soothing symptoms, and providing gentle nourishment. This aligns well with the lifestyle suggestions already provided.\n\nHere is a safe, balanced diet plan, emphasizing foods to prefer and those to limit or avoid during this time:\n\n### General Dietary Principles for Mild Illness:\n\n*   **Hydration is Key:** Continue to prioritize fluids as suggested by the lifestyle agent.\n*   **Easy to Digest:** Choose foods that are gentle on your stomach and don't require a lot of energy to process.\n*   **Nutrient-Dense:** Focus on foods that provide vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to support your immune system.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Your appetite might fluctuate. Eat when you're hungry, but don't force yourself. Small, frequent meals might be easier than large ones.\n\n### Foods to Prefer:\n\n1.  **Hydrating & Soothing Liquids:**\n    *   **Warm Broths & Soups:** Chicken noodle soup, vegetable broth, or clear consomm\u00e9s are excellent. They provide fluids, electrolytes, and easily digestible nutrients.\n    *   **Herbal Teas:** Ginger, chamomile, peppermint, or licorice root teas can be soothing for a sore throat and cough. Add a teaspoon of honey (for adults and children over 1 year) for extra relief.\n    *   **Warm Water with Lemon & Honey:** A classic for soothing sore throats and providing a gentle vitamin C boost.\n    *   **Plain Water:** Continue to sip water throughout the day.\n    *   **Electrolyte Drinks (diluted):** If you feel particularly dehydrated or have a poor appetite, diluted electrolyte solutions can help replenish minerals.\n\n2.  **Soft, Easy-to-Eat Foods:**\n    *   **Cooked Grains:** Oatmeal, cream of wheat, plain rice, or soft pasta. These provide energy and are gentle on the digestive system.\n    *   **Soft Fruits:** Bananas, applesauce, melon, peaches, or berries (especially blended into a smoothie). They are rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and fiber.\n    *   **Cooked Vegetables:** Steamed carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, spinach, or green beans. Cook them until very tender for easier digestion.\n    *   **Lean, Soft Proteins:** Soft-boiled or scrambled eggs, baked or poached fish, or shredded chicken (especially in soup). These provide essential amino acids for recovery.\n    *   **Yogurt or Kefir:** Plain, unsweetened varieties can provide probiotics, which support gut health and, by extension, immune function.\n    *   **Honey:** A natural cough suppressant and throat soother (again, for adults and children over 1 year).\n\n### Foods to Limit or Avoid:\n\n1.  **Irritating & Abrasive Foods:**\n    *   **Spicy Foods:** Can irritate a sore throat and potentially worsen a cough.\n    *   **Acidic Foods:** While whole fruits like oranges are generally fine, highly acidic foods or juices (like concentrated orange juice or tomato sauce) might irritate a sensitive throat for some individuals.\n    *   **Crunchy/Hard Foods:** Chips, crackers, hard toast, raw tough vegetables, or nuts can be abrasive and uncomfortable on a sore throat.\n    *   **Very Hot or Very Cold Foods/Drinks:** Extreme temperatures can sometimes irritate a sensitive throat. Aim for lukewarm or room temperature.\n\n2.  **Hard-to-Digest & Inflammatory Foods:**\n    *   **Fried or Greasy Foods:** These are harder to digest and can sometimes cause stomach upset.\n    *   **Highly Processed Foods:** Often high in unhealthy fats, sugar, and artificial ingredients, which offer little nutritional value and can potentially contribute to inflammation.\n    *   **Excessive Sugar:** Sugary drinks, candies, and desserts can suppress the immune system and may contribute to inflammation.\n    *   **Alcohol:** Dehydrating and can interfere with sleep and immune function.\n    *   **Excessive Caffeine:** Can be dehydrating and interfere with restful sleep, which is crucial for recovery.\n\n3.  **Potential Mucus-Thickening Foods (Individual Sensitivity):**\n    *   **Dairy Products:** While not everyone experiences this, some people find that dairy products (milk, cheese) can temporarily thicken mucus. If you notice this effect, you might consider limiting them, but plain yogurt is often well-tolerated and beneficial.\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n*   **This is General Guidance:** This dietary advice is intended to support your body during a mild illness. It is not a substitute for personalized medical advice from your doctor or a registered dietitian.\n*   **Monitor Your Symptoms:** Continue to pay attention to how you feel. If your symptoms worsen, you develop new concerns, or your appetite significantly declines, please consult your doctor again.\n*   **No Cures:** Diet can support your body's natural healing process, but it does not cure viral infections.\n\nBy focusing on these gentle, nutrient-rich foods and avoiding potential irritants, you can help your body recover more comfortably.",
      "fitness": "As your cautious fitness coach, my primary recommendation given your symptoms (mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and fatigue) and the doctor's suspected viral infection is to **prioritize rest and recovery**. Your body is working hard to fight off the infection, and strenuous activity can hinder this process and potentially worsen your symptoms.\n\nHowever, if you feel a *slight* improvement in your energy levels and your symptoms remain mild, very gentle movement can sometimes help with circulation and mood. The key here is **extreme caution and listening intently to your body.**\n\n**Always remember to consult your doctor before resuming any heavy exercise, and especially if your symptoms worsen or you develop new concerns.**\n\nHere are some low-risk, gentle physical activities you *might* consider, but only if you feel genuinely up to it:\n\n### Gentle Movement Plan (Optional and Highly Cautious)\n\n**Important Guidelines Before Starting:**\n\n*   **Listen to Your Body ABOVE ALL ELSE:** This is the most crucial rule. If you feel any pain, discomfort, increased fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, or worsening of your sore throat, cough, or runny nose, **STOP IMMEDIATELY.**\n*   **Keep it Short:** Sessions should be very brief, no more than 5-10 minutes at a time.\n*   **Low Intensity Only:** The goal is gentle movement, not to raise your heart rate significantly or break a sweat. You should be able to hold a full conversation comfortably throughout the activity.\n*   **Hydrate:** Ensure you are well-hydrated before, during, and after any activity, as emphasized in the diet and lifestyle advice.\n*   **Warm-up/Cool-down:** For these gentle activities, a \"warm-up\" might simply be a few deep breaths, and a \"cool-down\" is just stopping.\n\n---\n\n**1. Gentle Walking (Indoors or Outdoors, if weather permits):**\n    *   **Activity:** A very slow, leisurely walk.\n    *   **Duration:** Start with 5 minutes. If you feel absolutely fine, you *might* extend to 10 minutes, but err on the side of caution.\n    *   **Pace:** A stroll, not a brisk walk. Imagine you're window shopping.\n    *   **Environment:** Choose a flat, safe surface. If outdoors, ensure the air quality is good and the temperature is comfortable. Avoid cold, damp, or windy conditions that could irritate your respiratory system.\n    *   **Focus:** Pay attention to your breathing. If it becomes labored or your cough worsens, stop.\n\n**2. Light Stretching / Mobility Exercises:**\n    *   **Activity:** Gentle, static stretches that focus on improving flexibility and easing tension, rather than building strength or pushing limits.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Neck Rolls:** Slowly roll your head from side to side, ear to shoulder.\n        *   **Shoulder Rolls:** Gently roll your shoulders forward and backward.\n        *   **Arm Stretches:** Reach one arm across your body, gently pulling with the other.\n        *   **Cat-Cow Stretch (on hands and knees):** Gently arch and round your back.\n        *   **Child's Pose:** A restful pose that gently stretches the back and hips.\n        *   **Leg Swings (gentle, controlled):** Slowly swing one leg forward and backward, keeping it low.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes.\n    *   **Pace:** Slow and controlled. Hold each stretch for 15-20 seconds, breathing deeply.\n    *   **Focus:** Move within a comfortable range of motion. Do not force any stretch or bounce. If any stretch causes pain or increases your cough, stop that specific movement.\n\n**3. Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n    *   **Activity:** Focused, slow, deep breaths. This isn't \"exercise\" in the traditional sense, but it's a beneficial physical activity for lung health and relaxation.\n    *   **How to:** Sit or lie comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise. Exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your belly fall.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes, several times a day.\n    *   **Focus:** This can help soothe your respiratory system, promote relaxation, and manage fatigue.\n\n---\n\n**Connecting to Your Overall Recovery:**\n\nThese gentle movements, if you choose to do them, should complement the other crucial aspects of your recovery:\n\n*   **Rest:** Continue to prioritize extra sleep and naps as advised by the lifestyle agent.\n*   **Hydration:** Keep sipping those warm liquids and water.\n*   **Nutrition:** Stick to the easy-to-digest, nutrient-rich foods recommended by the diet agent.\n\n**Your body's priority right now is healing.

      "lifestyle": "Given the symptoms you've described (feeling tired throughout the day, mild headache, occasional dizziness, and body weakness, with slightly disturbed sleep), it's important to reiterate that **consulting a doctor for a proper diagnosis is the most crucial first step.** Dizziness and body weakness, even if mild, should be evaluated by a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n\nOnce you've consulted a doctor and received their guidance, or while awaiting an appointment, here are some safe and generic lifestyle changes and constraints that can support your overall well-being and potentially help manage some of these general symptoms. These are supportive measures, not a substitute for medical advice.\n\n---\n\n### Lifestyle Changes & Constraints (Supportive Measures)\n\n**1. Hydration & Nutrition:**\n\n*   **Increase Water Intake:** Aim to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Dehydration can contribute to headaches, fatigue, and dizziness. Keep a water bottle handy as a reminder.\n*   **Balanced Meals:** Focus on regular, balanced meals with whole foods. Include lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Avoid skipping meals.\n*   **Limit Processed Foods & Sugary Drinks:** These can lead to energy crashes and offer little nutritional value.\n*   **Reduce Caffeine & Alcohol (Especially Temporarily):** Both can disrupt sleep, contribute to dehydration, and potentially worsen headaches or dizziness. Consider cutting back significantly or eliminating them for a period to see if symptoms improve.\n\n**2. Movement & Physical Activity:**\n\n*   **Gentle Movement:** While experiencing weakness and dizziness, avoid strenuous exercise. Instead, opt for very gentle activities like short, slow walks (indoors or in a safe, familiar environment), gentle stretching, or chair yoga.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If any activity makes you feel worse, stop immediately. Do not push yourself.\n*   **Avoid Sudden Movements:** Stand up slowly from sitting or lying down to prevent dizziness.\n\n**3. Sleep Hygiene:**\n\n*   **Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on weekends, to regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n*   **Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine:** This could include a warm bath, reading a book (not on a screen), gentle stretching, or listening to calming music.\n*   **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:** Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n*   **Limit Screen Time Before Bed:** The blue light from phones, tablets, and computers can interfere with melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. Aim to stop using screens at least an hour before bed.\n*   **Avoid Heavy Meals Close to Bedtime:** Give your body time to digest before sleep.\n\n**4. Stress Management:**\n\n*   **Mindfulness & Deep Breathing:** Practice simple deep breathing exercises for a few minutes several times a day. Focus on slow, deep inhales and exhales.\n*   **Short Relaxation Breaks:** Incorporate brief moments of rest or quiet throughout your day. Even 5-10 minutes of sitting quietly can help.\n*   **Gentle Hobbies:** Engage in calming activities you enjoy, such as reading, listening to music, or light gardening.\n*   **Limit Overwhelm:** If possible, temporarily reduce commitments or delegate tasks to lessen your mental load.\n\n**5. Daily Routine Tips:**\n\n*   **Pacing Yourself:** Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Don't try to do too much at once.\n*   **Scheduled Rest Periods:** Intentionally schedule short rest breaks throughout your day, even if you don't feel immediately tired. This can help prevent reaching a state of exhaustion.\n*   **Prioritize Tasks:** Focus on essential tasks and postpone non-urgent ones if you're feeling unwell.\n*   **Seek Support:** Don't hesitate to ask for help from family or friends if you need it.\n\n---\n\n**Important Constraint:**\n\n*   **Avoid Self-Diagnosis and Self-Treatment:** Do not rely solely on lifestyle changes to address symptoms that could indicate a medical issue. **Your primary focus should be on getting a professional medical evaluation.**\n\nThese suggestions are designed to be generally beneficial for well-being.

Dehydration can worsen headaches and dizziness.\n\n2.  **Mindful, Slow Walking (Indoors or Very Safe Environment):**\n    *   **Duration:** Start with just 2-5 minutes.\n    *   **Intensity:** Very slow, leisurely pace. More like a stroll than a walk.\n    *   **Environment:** Walk in a familiar, flat, and safe environment, such as around your home or a very short, even path. Have something nearby to steady yourself if needed (e.g., a wall, furniture).\n    *   **Focus:** Pay attention to your balance. If you feel even a hint of dizziness or increased weakness, **STOP IMMEDIATELY** and sit down.\n    *   **Frequency:** Once or twice a day, if tolerated.\n\n3.  **Gentle Stretching (Seated or Supported):**\n    *   **Focus:** Simple, static stretches for major muscle groups. No bouncing or deep stretches.\n    *   **Neck Rolls:** Very slow, gentle half-circles from shoulder to shoulder.\n    *   **Shoulder Rolls:** Gentle forward and backward circles.\n    *   **Arm Stretches:** Extend arms gently overhead or to the sides.\n    *   **Leg Stretches (Seated):** Extend one leg forward, gently reach towards your toes (don't strain).\n    *   **Duration:** Hold each stretch for 10-15 seconds, breathing deeply.\n    *   **Safety:** Perform these while seated or holding onto a stable surface for support. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** if you feel any pain, dizziness, or discomfort.\n\n4.  **Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n    *   **Position:** Lie down or sit comfortably in a quiet space.\n    *   **Technique:** Place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your abdomen rise. Exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your abdomen fall.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes.\n    *   **Benefits:** Helps with relaxation, can improve oxygen flow, and is very low impact.\n\n5.  **Chair-Based Mobility:**\n    *   **Ankle Circles:** While seated, lift one foot slightly and gently rotate your ankle in circles, both clockwise and counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Knee Extensions:** While seated, gently extend one leg straight out, hold briefly, and lower.\n    *   **Arm Raises:** While seated, gently raise your arms out to the sides or forward, not above shoulder height if it causes strain.\n    *   **Safety:** Ensure your chair is stable.\n\n---\n\n**Crucial Safety Instructions and Warnings:**\n\n*   **CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR FIRST:** This cannot be stressed enough.

Your body is telling you it needs care. Do not ignore its signals.\n*   **No Heavy Exercise:** Absolutely avoid any strenuous activities, lifting heavy objects, high-intensity interval training, or anything that significantly raises your heart rate or makes you feel out of breath.\n*   **No New Activities:** Do not try any new or unfamiliar exercises until you have medical clearance.\n\nYour health and safety are the top priority.

Don't force yourself to eat if you have no appetite, but do prioritize liquids.\n\n---\n\nBy focusing on these gentle, nourishing foods and avoiding potential irritants, you can support your body's healing process while managing your mild symptoms.

      "fitness": "As a cautious fitness coach, my primary recommendation when you're experiencing symptoms like a mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and fatigue is to **prioritize rest and recovery**. Your body is working to heal, and strenuous activity can hinder that process and potentially worsen your symptoms.\n\nHowever, if you feel a slight improvement in your energy levels and wish to engage in some very gentle movement, here are some low-risk, low-intensity activities. The key is to **listen intently to your body and stop immediately if you feel any pain, discomfort, dizziness, or worsening of your symptoms.**\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Low-Risk, Gentle Physical Activities**\n\n1.  **Gentle Walking (Short Duration, Slow Pace):**\n    *   **Activity:** A very slow, leisurely walk, either indoors (around your home) or outdoors in mild weather.\n    *   **Intensity:** Keep it at a pace where you can easily hold a conversation without any breathlessness. This is not about getting your heart rate up.\n    *   **Duration:** Start with just 5-10 minutes. If you feel okay, you *might* extend it to 15-20 minutes, but only if you genuinely feel no increased fatigue or discomfort.\n    *   **Focus:** Light movement to promote circulation, not to exert yourself.\n\n2.  **Light Stretching / Mobility Exercises:**\n    *   **Activity:** Gentle stretches focusing on major muscle groups, holding each stretch for 15-30 seconds without bouncing. Think about neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, gentle arm circles, cat-cow stretches (if comfortable on hands and knees), and very light hamstring or quad stretches.\n    *   **Intensity:** Stretches should feel mild and relaxing, never painful or strenuous.\n    *   **Duration:** 5-10 minutes.\n    *   **Focus:** Improving flexibility and reducing stiffness without taxing your energy.\n\n3.  **Restorative Yoga (Very Gentle Poses):**\n    *   **Activity:** Focus on passive, supported poses using pillows or blankets. Examples include Child's Pose, Legs-Up-The-Wall, or a gentle reclined bound angle pose. Avoid any inversions, balancing poses, or poses that require significant strength or effort.\n    *   **Intensity:** The goal is relaxation and gentle opening, not deep stretching or muscle engagement.\n    *   **Duration:** 10-15 minutes.\n    *   **Focus:** Calming the nervous system and gentle body awareness.\n\n---\n\n### **Crucial Guidelines & Warnings:**\n\n*   **Listen to Your Body ABOVE ALL ELSE:** This is the most important rule. If you feel any increase in fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or worsening of your cough or sore throat, **STOP THE ACTIVITY IMMEDIATELY.**\n*   **Prioritize Rest:** If you feel fatigued, choose rest over any activity. Your body needs energy to fight off the illness.\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Continue to sip on water and warm liquids before, during, and after any gentle movement.\n*   **Avoid Heavy Exercise:** Absolutely no high-intensity interval training (HIIT), heavy weightlifting, long runs, intense cardio, or any activity that significantly elevates your heart rate or makes you breathe hard. Your body is not ready for this.\n*   **No \"Pushing Through\":** This is not the time to test your limits or try to \"sweat it out.\" Pushing yourself when ill can prolong recovery or lead to more severe symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Always remember to consult your doctor before engaging in any heavy exercise, especially when recovering from an illness or if your symptoms change or worsen.** Your health and safety are paramount.

Add a teaspoon of honey (for adults) for extra relief.\n    *   **Clear Broths & Soups:** Chicken or vegetable broth, or light, clear soups (e.g., chicken noodle soup with soft noodles and cooked vegetables) are excellent for hydration and provide gentle nutrients.\n    *   **Diluted Fruit Juices:** If tolerated, diluted apple or grape juice can provide some energy and hydration. Avoid highly acidic juices if your throat is very sore.\n    *   **Warm Water with Lemon & Honey:** A classic soothing remedy.\n\n2.  **Soft & Easy-to-Eat Foods:**\n    *   **Cooked Grains:** Oatmeal, cream of wheat, rice porridge (congee), or soft-cooked pasta.\n    *   **Soft Fruits:** Bananas, applesauce, melon, peaches, pears, berries (blended into a smoothie if preferred).\n    *   **Cooked Vegetables:** Steamed or boiled carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, green beans, or spinach.\n    *   **Lean, Soft Proteins:** Poached or baked chicken/fish (flaked), scrambled eggs, tofu, or lentils.\n    *   **Yogurt & Kefir:** Plain, unsweetened varieties can provide probiotics and are easy to swallow.\n    *   **Mashed Potatoes or Sweet Potatoes:** Comforting and easy to digest.\n\n3.  **Immune-Supporting Nutrients (from whole foods):**\n    *   **Vitamin C:** Found in citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruit, though be mindful of acidity if throat is very sore), berries, bell peppers, and broccoli.\n    *   **Zinc:** Found in lean meats, poultry, beans, nuts, and seeds.\n    *   **Vitamin D:** Found in fatty fish (salmon), fortified milk/plant milks, and eggs.\n    *   **Antioxidants:** Abundant in colorful fruits and vegetables.\n\n---\n\n### **Foods to Avoid or Limit:**\n\n1.  **Irritating & Acidic Foods:**\n    *   **Spicy Foods:** Can irritate a sore throat and potentially trigger coughing.\n    *   **Highly Acidic Foods:** Tomatoes, citrus fruits (if very sore throat), vinegar-based dressings might cause discomfort.\n    *   **Crunchy/Hard Foods:** Chips, crackers, raw vegetables, hard toast can scratch a sore throat.\n\n2.  **Heavy & Greasy Foods:**\n    *   **Fried Foods:** Can be difficult to digest and may cause stomach upset.\n    *   **Rich, Creamy Sauces:** May feel heavy and contribute to indigestion.\n\n3.  **Dehydrating & Inflammatory Foods:**\n    *   **Alcohol:** Dehydrating and can suppress the immune system.\n    *   **Excessive Caffeine:** Can be dehydrating.

This can be easier on your digestive system and help maintain energy levels when appetite is low.\n*   **Listen to Your Appetite:** Don't force yourself to eat if you're not hungry, but do prioritize liquids. When you do eat, choose nutrient-dense options.\n\n---\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** This general dietary guidance is intended to support your body during a mild illness.

Your body's signals are paramount.**\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Low-Risk, Gentle Physical Activities:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Rest & Sleep:**\n    *   This is not an activity, but it's the most important \"plan\" right now.
